
(This episode mostly takes place in a movie theater shaped like the Sphinx)
Lawrence: Ooh, you know, kids, this theater was built over 70 years ago in this Neo-Egyptian style. (He buys the tickets and they walk inside) And apparently, there used to be a pharaoh's tomb display with a mummy in a sarcophagus. I mean, you couldn't pick a better place to watch a classic, old mummy movie.

(Inside, They watch the movie entitled "Bones of Doom" with the other audience.)
Explorer: (In movie) There's an inscription here. An... an incantation of some sort. "Owah Tagu Siam!"
(The mummy wakes up at the sound of these words, looking straight at the audience. Phineas and Ferb stare back)
Phineas: (turns to his dad) Dad, where do you find a mummy?
Lawrence: Hidden deep in the bowels of the pyramids. (Phone rings) Whoops, better put this on vibrate.
(The mummy is now standing right behind the explorer, poised and ready to pounce)
Explorer: (In movie) The incantation will make the mummy come to life and obey your commands. Well, beat me with a chicken. (The mummy starts beating him with a chicken) Ow! What?! Ooh! Hey! Stop! It's an--ow! Hey!
Phineas: Cool! Dad, is it hard to get into a pyramid?
Lawrence: Yes, indeed. Often you had to negotiate many booby traps that were set centuries before.
(In the movie, the mummy has just stepped on a small rock, apparently a trigger for a booby trap)
Explorer: (In movie) You ridiculous mummy. You just tripped one of your own booby traps. (There is a rumbling noise, and rocks begin to fall on the explorer and the mummy) She's gonna blow!
(They run for the exit, barely getting out in time)
Phineas: Awesome booby trap! (at Ferb) Ferb, we should get our own mummy.

(Scene opens up showing buildings in England.)
Lawrence: Ooh! Merry old England. How I love our yearly holiday to my parents' home. Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, oh, the White Cliffs of Dover. Stonehenge.
Phineas: Either I’ve grown a lot in the last year, or England's gotten smaller.
Lawrence: Here we are. The old homestead.
Candace: Look! There's Grandma and Grandpa Fletcher.
Phineas: Grandpa! Grandma!
Grandpa Reg: Ahh! Phineas, Ferb! My boys!
Grandma Winifred: Oh, Ferb, you're looking more like your grandfather. Just look at that resemblance. What do you think, dear?
(She places a fake mustache and hairpiece on Ferb)
Grandpa Fletcher: He's a right handsome lad, he is.
Grandma Fletcher: You can keep these. I've got loads of them.
Candace: Hi, Grandpa. Hi, Grandma.
Grandpa Fletcher: Candace? Can that be you? You look like a right beauteous princess.
Candace: Thanks!
(Car honking)
Lawrence: Ta-ta. We're off to the antique convention. See you tonight.
Phineas: Hey, Gramps, what's that cool castle next door?
Grandpa Fletcher: Oh, aye, that's our neighbors, Lord and Lady Pipping. It used to belong to the Black Knight.
Phineas: The Black Knight?
Grandpa Fletcher: Such a wonderful tale of valor.

Grandpa Fletcher: Here, immortalized in bronze, is the Black Knight himself and his Hounds of Heck on their final charge to vanquish the dragon. And here is the disastrous results. (Reginald leads the boys to a statue that shows the dragon with forks and knives, while the black knight is being cooked) Legend says that the Black Knight's ghost still haunts these foggy moors, riding in search of the dragon, followed by his pack of fierce hounds.
Phineas: Hey, I know what we should do today. Grandpa Fletcher, let's have a medieval tournament just like the knights did in the days of yore. We can he jousting and catapults and not bathe.
Grandpa Fletcher: Way ahead of you on the not bathing.

Candace: (Sighs) Man, Stacy, everything here is so old, wet and small, and... and...
Charles: En garde, Stubbings! Ha ha! Come on, man! Parry and riposte. (laughs) I've run you through, Stubbings.
Stubbings: Yes. Delightful, Master Charles. Clearly, you have mastered the rules of tennis.
Candace: Uh, Stacy, I'll call you back.
Stubbings: I believe it's my serve. Oh, dear. I have punned.
(Charles laughs)

Phineas: (Dressed as a fool) Back it up! Back it up! (Trucks beep) Good. Right there. Lumber over here, suckling pigs over there. Hold it! That pig's barely suckling. What do I look like, a fool? (The man carrying the pig shoves an apple into the pig's mouth) That's what I'm talking about. Carry on. (To Ferb) So, you ready to chop some lumber, Ferb? (Ferb salutes) Hey, where's Perry?

(At Perry's lair...)
Major Monogram: Ahh, Agent P. Sorry about the tight squeeze, but they're on the metric system. Doofenshmirtz is attending an evil scientists' convention in London. We're sending you in undercover, disguised as evil scientist Dr. Lloyd Wexler who, incidentally, is the man sitting next to you. Good luck, Agent P.

(Back in England Phineas is building a horse)
Candace: Phineas?
Phineas: Oh, hi, Candace.
Candace: What do you think you're doing?
Phineas: I think I'm building a horse.
(The horse whinnies)
Candace: There's a cute boy next door, and I don't want you guys scaring him off by acting like complete freaks.
Charles: Beg pardon?
Candace: Hello. (Giggles)
Charles: I'm Charles Pipping the Fourth.
Candace: I'm Candace Flynn... the First.
Charles: So, what's all this?
Candace: This? Uh... This is just a--
Phineas: We're putting on a medieval tournament.
Candace: Medieval tournament? That has to be, without a doubt, the most--
Charles: Brilliant idea I've heard in years!
Candace: Exactly. (Laughs) Because who doesn't love whatever happens at one of those... Those... Things?
Phineas: Wanna join us?
Charles: Absolutely. We could use my family's castle as a backdrop. And you can be the fair princess in the tower, waiting to be rescued by a handsome knight.
Candace: (she blinks twice) Okay!

(At Evil-Con)
Man #1: Welcome to Evil-Con, Dr. Lloyd Wexler. Hey! Wait a second. (Moves ID card to reveal Perry disguised as Dr. Wexler) You didn't get your evil button. Enjoy the convention, Dr. Wexler.

(At the castle)
Candace: (With a fake British accent) As the fair princess in the tower, I declare Sir Charles the winner of the tournament... (Thinks using her normal voice) Wait a second. Could this be one of those things that backfires horribly on me? (Pauses) Nah.
Charles: Looks like that armor is big enough for the two of you.
Phineas: That's a great idea. (To Ferb) Ferb, I'll take the top half because I tend to do more of the talking, and you take the bottom half because of your incredibly long, willowy legs.
Candace: Yoo-hoo! Sir Charles! They can't even hear me up here. (She yells) Yo, Chuck! (Growls) What is going on down there? (She attempts to open the door, but only manages to pull the handle off) Oh, come on! Hey, guys! I am locked in the tower!
Phineas: That's the spirit, Candace! You sound like a real damsel in distress!
Candace: (She growls) I have got to get out of here. (She tries to grab a spear from a knights grip) Let go! Come on, let go! Fine! Have it your way. (She picks up the armor, and smashes through the door. However, soon after the armor becomes undone, and Candace lands in it, making her look like the Black Knight)

Charles: Well, then, since you chaps are just about put together, I think it's time I popped next door to fetch my own armor.
Phineas: There's something almost disturbing about this. Hey, look. he's back.
Candace: (Grunts)
Phineas: Okay, Charles, we'll help you get on your horse and do a practice run.
Candace: (Muffled scream)

(At Evil-Con)
Doofenshmirtz: You didn't think I'd recognize you, did you? But I do! You're Dr. Lloyd Wexler, my greatest hero in all of evil science. Oh, I can't believe I'm actually talking to you! You know, I wrote my thesis on one of your early ransom notes. Gee, you wouldn't mind if I just hung around with you today, would you?
Perry: (He blinks twice)

(At the castle)
(Horn salute)
Grandpa Fletcher: Lords and ladies of the court, I declare that this contest is to begin!
(Cheering)
Grandpa Fletcher: Are you boys ready over there?
Phineas: Ready, Ferb?
(Ferb opens a compartment in the armor to give a thumbs up)
Phineas: We're ready, Grandpa!
Grandpa Fletcher: How about you, Charles?
Candace: (Muffled screaming)
Grandpa Fletcher: That's the spirit.
(Phineas and Ferb, and Candace begin their jousting match. Candace's horse however bucks her off, sending her into a catapult)
Phineas: Look, our catapult works.
(Cadence gets launched into the castle, but falls down the tower, and back onto the horse, who, in turn, bucks her off, repeating the cycle)
Grandpa Fletcher: Way to hang in there, Charles.
(Candace's horse runs off with her on it)
Phineas: Guess we won, Ferb. Yeah!
Charles: What ho, chaps. Still up for a bit of a joust?
Stubbings: Your lance, sir.
Phineas: Charles? Then who's that?
Grandpa Fletcher: Perhaps it was the ghost of the Black Knight. But I wonder where his Hounds of Heck are.

(Instrumental version of "Ballad of the Black Knight" playing in the background)
(Candace's horse continues to run down the street, causing a gravy truck to crash, spraying her with it, while also releasing dogs from an animal control van)
Man #2: (Upon seeing this) It's the ghost of the Black Knight and his hounds of Heck!

(At Evil-Con)
Doofenshmirtz: It makes me so happy to be surrounded by so much evil. Oh, look! It's your autobiography. It's always been a dream of mine to have you read it to me. (He pauses) Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait! (Pulls out a teddy bear) Okay, now I'm ready.
Doofenshmirtz: (laughs) Come on! Don't be shy. Paragraph 4. "Upon an evil winter's heart." Go ahead.
Perry: (lip-syching from the book on CD) "Upon an evil winter's heart, the heavy hand of regret infrequently alights. The malevolent path is one trod without the cumbersome shackles of sentimental introspec... spec... spec... spec... spec... spec... spec..." (He whacks the CD player with the book)
Doofenshmirtz: Hmm, that's funny. I don't remember you saying "spec" so many times. (Perry rips off his disguise) Dr. Wexler, you're a platypus. (Perry, looking annoyed, puts his fedora on. Doofenshmirtz gasps) Perry the Platypus!
Doofenshmirtz: I want to say that I knew it was you all along, but I can't because I didn't. So now, I guess I'm supposed to surrender, which I might do if we weren't standing IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EVIL WEAPONS EXPO! (He runs to the giant robots, and gets in one) Ah-ha! Perry the Platypus, your giant robot dragon is no match for my giant robot... Queen Elizabeth I. Hmmm. W- Would you mind switching robots with me? Would you mind too terribly? Please? (They switch robots) Thanks. Thank you very much. I just prefer this one. Thanks. Now, Perry the Platypus, your silly, girly Queen Elizabeth I robot is no match for my giant, fire-breathing... (Perry's robot shoots a laser blast at Doofenshmirtz) Ow! Ow! Wait! I didn't know she had laser eyes. I want to trade back. (Perry sends a punch at Doofenshmirtz) Oof! Well, yours may have laser eyes, but mine breathes (The dragon robot shoots fire from behind Doof) f- (He screams as the fire rushes past) (The dragon robot stops shooting fire) That was a stupid design.

(At the castle)
Grandpa Fletcher: Commence with round Two!

(With that, Charles, now wearing his knight helmet, charged towards Phineas and Ferb with his horse. This time however, Phineas and Ferb found themselves on both sides of their armor, with their heads sticking out from where the hands are. )
Phineas: Uh, oh! Ferb, I think we put it on sideways this time.
(The two horses crash into one another)
Grandpa Fletcher: It's a draw!
(The crowd cheers)

TV Announcer: This just in: A giant mechanical Queen Elizabeth I and a dragon are rampaging through the country engaged in an apparent duel to the death. And in other news, a new version of Jane Eyre is in the offing.

(the robots continue fighting)
Lawrence: (Reading from a newspaper inside a taxicab driving past the fight) Good heavens, look at that! They're making a new version of Jane Eyre.
Doofenshmirtz: (Laughs) Obviously, your Queen Elizabeth I is no match for my dragon! (The Queen Elizabeth robot breaks the headlock she was in) That Queen Elizabeth is a tough old bird.
(Perry continues to wail on Doofenshmirtz, until, Doofenshmirtz accidentally pushes a button)
Computer: Thank you for pressing the self-destruct button.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, that's just great!
(He slams down on the console)
Computer: Thank you for pressing the ejection button. Remember to take a parachute with you.
Doofenshmirtz: Now you tell me!

(At the castle)
Charles: Look, everyone, it's the ghost of the Black Knight.
Phineas: I guess he's still in search of the dragon.
(The Dragon falls onto the medieval festive)
Computer: To order a parachute, please call our help desk. Self-destruct in 3, 2, 1.
(As the dragon self destructs, Candace runs into it. The resulting explosion sends Candace into the castle, then crashing back down the tower, only to be caught by Charles)
Candace: Hi, Charles.
Grandpa Fletcher: Jolly good, old bean.
Phineas: Ah! There you are, Perry.
Lawrence: Hello. we had the most amazing time. Look! I found this 19th century barometer. Anything interesting happen 'round here?
(There's silence for a moment)
Ferb: I hear there's a new version of Jane Eyre in the offing.
♪ Yeah ♪

Phineas: That would be awesome! (At Lawrence) Dad, can we-- (Lawrence is snoring; to Ferb) Come on, Ferb. We'll be back before he wakes up.
Candace: Oh, those bozos aren't pulling anything on my watch! (Candace follows them, only to get caught between the doors)
Phineas: Hey, Ferb. Where's Perry?

(Agent P enters a secret entrance and takes a vehicle; Major Monogram appears on the screen)
Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz is at it again. It appears that he's purchased a string of odd items: One pound of blood sausage- Ech, that's my grocery list. Here it is. One magnet, one map of the city's drainage pipes and 2 tons of scrap metal. It's in your hands now, Agent P. Over and out.

Computer voice: Dive. Dive. Dive.
(The submarine dives less than a foot into the water which wasn't very deep; yet he continues onward)

(At the theater's lobby...)
Phineas: Mr. Employee, sir, where's the mummy exhibit?
Employee: (Presses button) Manager assistance requested.
Employee #2: Yes?
Employee: These boys want to know where the mummy exhibit is.
Employee #2: It's in storage. In the basement.
Phineas: Guess who's goin' to the basement!
Woman: Uh, excuse me, where are the restrooms?
Employee: Manager assistance requested.
Employee #2: Yes?

(Candace is peeking out from behind a plant)
Candace: There they go.
(The boys open the door to find...)
Phineas: Look! Pith helmets! We might be going the right way. Say something pithy.
Candace: That's it. I'm calling Dad.

(At the movie, Lawrence's cell phone vibrates)
Lawrence: (Laughs) Ohh!

(Back to Candace)
Candace: Oh, forget it! I'm going in myself. (knocks over a series of posts, which strike a gumball machine and cause the gumball container to come loose and roll after her. Candace enters the stairwell and steps in a mop bucket with wheels that's full of water and goes down the stairs)
Phineas: Did you hear that? Maybe it's the mummy.
Candace: (lands at the bottom of the stairway) Eww. My shoe is all squishy!
(The gumball container rolls toward the door, down the stairs and towards the boys. Ferb immediately gets on Phineas' shoulders)
Phineas: Uh, Ferb? What are you doing? (Ferb extends his arms out an grabs a pipe and they land on the gumball container) Woah! Who knew looking for mummies would be so much fun? Watch this! (They then do some tricks before ramming above the door) Ugh! (They land and watch the gumball container roll away) Hey, Ferb, this was our first booby trap! Woo! Hey, look! The storage! We're here!
(Back to Candace)
Candace: Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, when I catch them...
(She sees the gumball container coming and runs for it; she tries to go over the gumball container, but the pipe breaks, causing her to stare at the camera bemusedly; she tries again, but she lands in the overhead duct and comes out beat up) Oh, give me a break! (The gumball container then rolls past her, up the stairs and into the elevator; Candace sees this and walks away and gets into an elevator)
(Song: I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun! elevator music)
(Candace sees the gumball container in the elevator and runs out with the gumball in pursuit; she tries a couple of storage doors, but they're locked. Eventually the gumball container breaks and she rolls into a supplies closet)
Candace: Bubble gum? Oh, really old, stale bubble gum! Blaugh! (she inadvertently gets some butter and toilet paper on her and she walks out looking like a mummy) Phineas!

(At the dam, Doofenshmirtz is working on an inator; Perry surfaces)
Doofenshmirtz: Almost done, just this one more little bit! (Perry appears and kicks the paintbrush out of Doof's hand) Perry the Platypus! As usual, your timing is incredible! And by "Incredible", of course I mean: COMPLETELY CREDIBLE! (Laser fires trapping Perry in a ball) No use, Perry the Platypus! I made this out of something that cannot be penetrated! Pure evil! And a blend of space-age polymers. You see, Perry the Platypus, I'm going to unleash the water held by this dam into that huge drainage pipe that leads directly to the ocean. The additional water will raise the sea level by 2%, and then my property one block from the shoreline will become beachfront property! (Laughs maniacally) And to release the water from the dam, I've invented a ray, which attracts wood like it attracts metal: The Wood-inator! Which was almost complete until you rudely interrupted me. Oh, look at this, Perry. It's my paintbrush. You know, the one you knocked out of my hand a few moments ago. Maybe you want to take it back from me now, huh? Huh, you want to try? (Laughs) Goodbye, Perry the Platypus! (pushes Perry into the river)

(Cut back to the boys; they go in and approach a fake mummy)
Phineas: Owah Tagu Siam! (Phineas grabs the fake mummy and inadvertently pops it) There's nothing here but fakey promotional lobby junk. For all we know, there might not be such thing as a mummy. (At Mummy Candace) Yeah, I'll be right with you. I mean-- (Gasps)
Candace: Phineas!
Phineas: (Screams; Slams door)

[They evade Candace at different points of the room; finally they hide inside a Safari Man 2 in 3D stand-up display]
Phineas: Wow, I didn't expect them to be so scary. I mean, can you imagine the angry, twisted soul hidden under those bandages?
Candace: Phineas!
Phineas: Makes me shudder. But you know what? We came down here looking for a mummy, and I'm not leaving without one. Let's get him! (Egyptian Guitar Solo continues while the boys try to catch Candace; finally they catch her by enclosing her in a wooden Egyptian coffin.) Hey, Ferb. We got our own mummy! Now, how are we going to get it home?

(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: And... finished! (presses a button that picks up parts of the dam; one of the beavers sees Perry in the bubble. They chatter and the beaver takes a log and chews it down to a toothpick, but uses his own teeth to burst the bubble that has Perry trapped. They shake hands and slap tails and Perry runs back to the beaver dam)
♪ Perry! ♪
(Cut back to the Woodenator)
Doofenshmirtz:It is working! (laughs) It is functioning properly! (Perry chatters, getting his attention; he gasps) Perry the Platypus? You defeated my bubble of pure evil? Ooh! (he traps himself and Perry in a bubble and land in the river just as the dam falls apart) Oh, no! What? (Perry uses Doofenshmirtz's nose to pop the bubble and escapes) Is my nose really that pointy?
(The river rolls all the way into a pipe that leads to the theater; Perry leaps out just as the hallway starts to flood; cut to the boys)
Phineas: You know what this is? Our second booby trap! (Water splashing; drifting the boys off with the coffin and Perry) There you are, Perry. (Perry chatters; they then go down a rapid) WOO-HOO-HOO! OH YEAH! (they then go up the rapid) WOO-HOO! (They burst through the roof) OH YEAH! (they land near the car; at Candace) Hey, Candace, you missed all the fun. Allow me to introduce our mummy. (realizes the "mummy" isn't there) Hey, where's our mummy? Mummy? Mummy?
Lawrence: Well, Mummy has supper waiting for us at home. (at Candace) Candace, why are you all wet?
Candace: (Growls)

Jeremy asked me if I could meet him at the fair later today next to the Ferris wheel.
Oh, no! I almost forgot I'm scared of heights! What am I going to do?
Linda: (Calling from downstairs) Candace, we're leaving now!
Candace: Mom, I'm having a teenage crisis!
Linda: Don't forget we're going bowling.
We need you to keep an eye on the boys.
Lawrence: Preferably two.
Phineas: Bowling? That sounds fun.
Hey, Dad, is it alright if we use that old lawn-bowling set?
Lawrence: Sure thing, boys! Knock yourselves out.
Linda: Toodles!

(Outside, in the backyard)
Phineas: You know, Ferb, with a few modifications, we could really zip up this old lawn-bowling set.
Baljeet: Hello, Phineas. What'you doing?
Ooh! I just sounded like Isabella.
Phineas: We're gonna build the world's biggest and best bowling-ball game!
Baljeet: Well, according to The Most Pointless Book of World Records...
(♪ Fanfare; a brief pause)
...the world's largest bowling ball is four feet in diameter.
Phineas: Four feet? Ferb, we could beat that record in our sleep.
Baljeet: You know, the officials from The Most Pointless Book of World Records...
(♪ Fanfare)
...will be at the fair today at 3:00, handing out awards.
Phineas: Ferb, get the tools. We've got a record to shatter.
Baljeet: And then you will be in the next volume!

Buford: Why? Does it bug ya?

Don't ask us how we know. Get out there and kick some Doofen-butt.

Phineas: Well, first of all, the cockpit's on a gyroscope so it stays level.
Here's your monitor, and this is the trackball you use to steer.
Now, no matter what, never hit the gyro stabilizer lock button! It'll disable the gyroscope, and you'll spin around like a greased pig on roller skates.
Candace: Yeah, yeah, use the trackball. Don't hit the button. I got it!
Phineas: All right. You seem to know what you're doing.
Candace: Do I ever?
This is a piece of cake.

Phineas: Ferb, the map of Danville's underground.
(Ferb pulls out aforesaid map)
Looks like she's headed downtown.

Candace: Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
(The ball stops on a railroad)
(Sighs) Oh, good, it stopped!
(Eyes widen) WAIT...
(Notices a train coming via monitor) Go, go, go, go, go!
(The train hits the ball, it rolls down the railroad and through a station)
Barry: That's one big bowling ball, Bob.
Bob: You betcha, Barry.

Phineas: Here she comes!
Buford/Baljeet: Go, Candace!
Buford: There she goes.
Phineas: All right, guys! To Seventh Street!

(At the abandoned self storage. Perry frees himself from the ice trap by using a mug of hot chocolate. He then leaves using his grappling hook.)

Baljeet: Candace! You can do it! Go, Candace!
Isabella: Go! Go! Go!
(Dinging)
Phineas: Hey, Baljeet, what's the world record for the largest pinball machine?
Baljeet: I am not sure, but I know we can beat it.
Phineas: Okay, everybody, split up and let's keep her in play until we get to the fair.

Announcer: Welcome, Danvillians, to the World's Most Pointless Records Awards! Let's meet some of our record holders. Here we have Cletus with the world's hairiest pig. Next to him is Margaret with the world's stinkiest cheese. And finally, we got little Timmy holding the world's fattest gerbil. Let's have a big round of applause for the most pointless world-record winners!
(Scattered applause)
Phineas: Wait! We've got two more World's Most Pointless Records for our own!
Announcer: Well, then, step right up, sonny, and tell everybody what they are.
Phineas: Our first entry is for the world's largest bowling ball, and the other is for the world's largest game of pinball!
Announcer: Wow! Well, let's see 'em!
Ferb: Wait for it.
(Dinging)
Announcer: Looks like we have two more World's Most Pointless Records! (Gasps) Wait, two records in one day? That's another world record!

Doofenshmirtz: To the fair, my pets, where the freezing of the Tri-State Area will begin! (Later notices the bowling ball) Wait. Wait, what is that? A giant bowling ball? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Candace: AAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Eventually lands next to Jeremy on the Ferris wheel)
Jeremy: Oh, Candace, you made it. I was thinking you weren't gonna show. Although, you know, usually we get on at the bottom.
Candace: (Giggles)
Phineas: (On microphone) We'd especially like to thank our sister, Candace. We couldn't have done it without you, sis!
Jeremy: You know, your brothers are all right. Hey, are you okay? (Candace points to the ground) Oh, afraid of heights. Don't worry, I got ya.
Phineas: How about you, Perry? Is there anything you'd like to add?
(Perry chatters)
akes place in a movie theater shaped like the Sphinx)
Lawrence: Ooh, you know, kids, this theater was built over 70 years ago in this Neo-Egyptian style. (He buys the tickets and they walk inside) And apparently, there used to be a pharaoh's tomb display with a mummy in a sarcophagus. I mean, you couldn't pick a better place to watch a classic, old mummy movie.

(Inside, They watch the movie entitled "Bones of Doom" with the other audience.)
Explorer: (In movie) There's an inscription here. An... an incantation of some sort. "Owah Tagu Siam!"
(The mummy wakes up at the sound of these words, looking straight at the audience. Phineas and Ferb stare back)
Phineas: (turns to his dad) Dad, where do you find a mummy?
Lawrence: Hidden deep in the bowels of the pyramids. (Phone rings) Whoops, better put this on vibrate.
(The mummy is now standing right behind the explorer, poised and ready to pounce)
Explorer: (In movie) The incantation will make the mummy come to life and obey your commands. Well, beat me with a chicken. (The mummy starts beating him with a chicken) Ow! What?! Ooh! Hey! Stop! It's an--ow! Hey!
Phineas: Cool! Dad, is it hard to get into a pyramid?
Lawrence: Yes, indeed. Often you had to negotiate many booby traps that were set centuries before.
(In the movie, the mummy has just stepped on a small rock, apparently a trigger for a booby trap)
Explorer: (In movie) You ridiculous mummy. You just tripped one of your own booby traps. (There is a rumbling noise, and rocks begin to fall on the explorer and the mummy) She's gonna blow!
(They run for the exit, barely getting out in time)
Phineas: Awesome booby trap! (at Ferb) Ferb, we should get our own mummy.

Lawrence: Ooh! Merry old England. How I love our yearly holiday to my parents' home. Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, oh, the White Cliffs of Dover. Stonehenge.
Phineas: Either I’ve grown a lot in the last year, or England's gotten smaller.
Lawrence: Here we are. The old homestead.
Candace: Look! There's Grandma and Grandpa Fletcher.
Phineas: Grandpa! Grandma!
Grandpa Reg: Ahh! Phineas, Ferb! My boys!
Grandma Winifred: Oh, Ferb, you're looking more like your grandfather. Just look at that resemblance. What do you think, dear?
(She places a fake mustache and hairpiece on Ferb)
Grandpa Fletcher: He's a right handsome lad, he is.
Grandma Fletcher: You can keep these. I've got loads of them.
Candace: Hi, Grandpa. Hi, Grandma.
Grandpa Fletcher: Candace? Can that be you? You look like a right beauteous princess.
Candace: Thanks!
(Car honking)
Lawrence: Ta-ta. We're off to the antique convention. See you tonight.
Phineas: Hey, Gramps, what's that cool castle next door?
Grandpa Fletcher: Oh, aye, that's our neighbors, Lord and Lady Pipping. It used to belong to the Black Knight.
Phineas: The Black Knight?
Grandpa Fletcher: Such a wonderful tale of valor.

Grandpa Fletcher: Here, immortalized in bronze, is the Black Knight himself and his Hounds of Heck on their final charge to vanquish the dragon. And here is the disastrous results. (Reginald leads the boys to a statue that shows the dragon with forks and knives, while the black knight is being cooked) Legend says that the Black Knight's ghost still haunts these foggy moors, riding in search of the dragon, followed by his pack of fierce hounds.
Phineas: Hey, I know what we should do today. Grandpa Fletcher, let's have a medieval tournament just like the knights did in the days of yore. We can he jousting and catapults and not bathe.
Grandpa Fletcher: Way ahead of you on the not bathing.

Candace: (Sighs) Man, Stacy, everything here is so old, wet and small, and... and...
Charles: En garde, Stubbings! Ha ha! Come on, man! Parry and riposte. (laughs) I've run you through, Stubbings.
Stubbings: Yes. Delightful, Master Charles. Clearly, you have mastered the rules of tennis.
Candace: Uh, Stacy, I'll call you back.
Stubbings: I believe it's my serve. Oh, dear. I have punned.
(Charles laughs)

Phineas: (Dressed as a fool) Back it up! Back it up! (Trucks beep) Good. Right there. Lumber over here, suckling pigs over there. Hold it! That pig's barely suckling. What do I look like, a fool? (The man carrying the pig shoves an apple into the pig's mouth) That's what I'm talking about. Carry on. (To Ferb) So, you ready to chop some lumber, Ferb? (Ferb salutes) Hey, where's Perry?

(At Perry's lair...)
Major Monogram: Ahh, Agent P. Sorry about the tight squeeze, but they're on the metric system. Doofenshmirtz is attending an evil scientists' convention in London. We're sending you in undercover, disguised as evil scientist Dr. Lloyd Wexler who, incidentally, is the man sitting next to you. Good luck, Agent P.

(Back in England Phineas is building a horse)
Candace: Phineas?
Phineas: Oh, hi, Candace.
Candace: What do you think you're doing?
Phineas: I think I'm building a horse.
(The horse whinnies)
Candace: There's a cute boy next door, and I don't want you guys scaring him off by acting like complete freaks.
Charles: Beg pardon?
Candace: Hello. (Giggles)
Charles: I'm Charles Pipping the Fourth.
Candace: I'm Candace Flynn... the First.
Charles: So, what's all this?
Candace: This? Uh... This is just a--
Phineas: We're putting on a medieval tournament.
Candace: Medieval tournament? That has to be, without a doubt, the most--
Charles: Brilliant idea I've heard in years!
Candace: Exactly. (Laughs) Because who doesn't love whatever happens at one of those... Those... Things?
Phineas: Wanna join us?
Charles: Absolutely. We could use my family's castle as a backdrop. And you can be the fair princess in the tower, waiting to be rescued by a handsome knight.
Candace: (she blinks twice) Okay!

(At Evil-Con)
Man #1: Welcome to Evil-Con, Dr. Lloyd Wexler. Hey! Wait a second. (Moves ID card to reveal Perry disguised as Dr. Wexler) You didn't get your evil button. Enjoy the convention, Dr. Wexler.

(At the castle)
Candace: (With a fake British accent) As the fair princess in the tower, I declare Sir Charles the winner of the tournament... (Thinks using her normal voice) Wait a second. Could this be one of those things that backfires horribly on me? (Pauses) Nah.
Charles: Looks like that armor is big enough for the two of you.
Phineas: That's a great idea. (To Ferb) Ferb, I'll take the top half because I tend to do more of the talking, and you take the bottom half because of your incredibly long, willowy legs.
Candace: Yoo-hoo! Sir Charles! They can't even hear me up here. (She yells) Yo, Chuck! (Growls) What is going on down there? (She attempts to open the door, but only manages to pull the handle off) Oh, come on! Hey, guys! I am locked in the tower!
Phineas: That's the spirit, Candace! You sound like a real damsel in distress!
Candace: (She growls) I have got to get out of here. (She tries to grab a spear from a knights grip) Let go! Come on, let go! Fine! Have it your way. (She picks up the armor, and smashes through the door. However, soon after the armor becomes undone, and Candace lands in it, making her look like the Black Knight)

Charles: Well, then, since you chaps are just about put together, I think it's time I popped next door to fetch my own armor.
Phineas: There's something almost disturbing about this. Hey, look. he's back.
Candace: (Grunts)
Phineas: Okay, Charles, we'll help you get on your horse and do a practice run.
Candace: (Muffled scream)

(At Evil-Con)
Doofenshmirtz: You didn't think I'd recognize you, did you? But I do! You're Dr. Lloyd Wexler, my greatest hero in all of evil science. Oh, I can't believe I'm actually talking to you! You know, I wrote my thesis on one of your early ransom notes. Gee, you wouldn't mind if I just hung around with you today, would you?
Perry: (He blinks twice)

(At the castle)
(Horn salute)
Grandpa Fletcher: Lords and ladies of the court, I declare that this contest is to begin!
(Cheering)
Grandpa Fletcher: Are you boys ready over there?
Phineas: Ready, Ferb?
(Ferb opens a compartment in the armor to give a thumbs up)
Phineas: We're ready, Grandpa!
Grandpa Fletcher: How about you, Charles?
Candace: (Muffled screaming)
Grandpa Fletcher: That's the spirit.
(Phineas and Ferb, and Candace begin their jousting match. Candace's horse however bucks her off, sending her into a catapult)
Phineas: Look, our catapult works.
(Cadence gets launched into the castle, but falls down the tower, and back onto the horse, who, in turn, bucks her off, repeating the cycle)
Grandpa Fletcher: Way to hang in there, Charles.
(Candace's horse runs off with her on it)
Phineas: Guess we won, Ferb. Yeah!
Charles: What ho, chaps. Still up for a bit of a joust?
Stubbings: Your lance, sir.
Phineas: Charles? Then who's that?
Grandpa Fletcher: Perhaps it was the ghost of the Black Knight. But I wonder where his Hounds of Heck are.

(Instrumental version of "Ballad of the Black Knight" playing in the background)
(Candace's horse continues to run down the street, causing a gravy truck to crash, spraying her with it, while also releasing dogs from an animal control van)
Man #2: (Upon seeing this) It's the ghost of the Black Knight and his hounds of Heck!

(At Evil-Con)
Doofenshmirtz: It makes me so happy to be surrounded by so much evil. Oh, look! It's your autobiography. It's always been a dream of mine to have you read it to me. (He pauses) Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait! (Pulls out a teddy bear) Okay, now I'm ready.
Doofenshmirtz: (laughs) Come on! Don't be shy. Paragraph 4. "Upon an evil winter's heart." Go ahead.
Perry: (lip-syching from the book on CD) "Upon an evil winter's heart, the heavy hand of regret infrequently alights. The malevolent path is one trod without the cumbersome shackles of sentimental introspec... spec... spec... spec... spec... spec... spec..." (He whacks the CD player with the book)
Doofenshmirtz: Hmm, that's funny. I don't remember you saying "spec" so many times. (Perry rips off his disguise) Dr. Wexler, you're a platypus. (Perry, looking annoyed, puts his fedora on. Doofenshmirtz gasps) Perry the Platypus!
Doofenshmirtz: I want to say that I knew it was you all along, but I can't because I didn't. So now, I guess I'm supposed to surrender, which I might do if we weren't standing IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EVIL WEAPONS EXPO! (He runs to the giant robots, and gets in one) Ah-ha! Perry the Platypus, your giant robot dragon is no match for my giant robot... Queen Elizabeth I. Hmmm. W- Would you mind switching robots with me? Would you mind too terribly? Please? (They switch robots) Thanks. Thank you very much. I just prefer this one. Thanks. Now, Perry the Platypus, your silly, girly Queen Elizabeth I robot is no match for my giant, fire-breathing... (Perry's robot shoots a laser blast at Doofenshmirtz) Ow! Ow! Wait! I didn't know she had laser eyes. I want to trade back. (Perry sends a punch at Doofenshmirtz) Oof! Well, yours may have laser eyes, but mine breathes (The dragon robot shoots fire from behind Doof) f- (He screams as the fire rushes past) (The dragon robot stops shooting fire) That was a stupid design.

(At the castle)
Grandpa Fletcher: Commence with round Two!

(With that, Charles, now wearing his knight helmet, charged towards Phineas and Ferb with his horse. This time however, Phineas and Ferb found themselves on both sides of their armor, with their heads sticking out from where the hands are. )
Phineas: Uh, oh! Ferb, I think we put it on sideways this time.
(The two horses crash into one another)
Grandpa Fletcher: It's a draw!
(The crowd cheers)

TV Announcer: This just in: A giant mechanical Queen Elizabeth I and a dragon are rampaging through the country engaged in an apparent duel to the death. And in other news, a new version of Jane Eyre is in the offing.

(the robots continue fighting)
Lawrence: (Reading from a newspaper inside a taxicab driving past the fight) Good heavens, look at that! They're making a new version of Jane Eyre.
Doofenshmirtz: (Laughs) Obviously, your Queen Elizabeth I is no match for my dragon! (The Queen Elizabeth robot breaks the headlock she was in) That Queen Elizabeth is a tough old bird.
(Perry continues to wail on Doofenshmirtz, until, Doofenshmirtz accidentally pushes a button)
Computer: Thank you for pressing the self-destruct button.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, that's just great!
(He slams down on the console)
Computer: Thank you for pressing the ejection button. Remember to take a parachute with you.
Doofenshmirtz: Now you tell me!

(At the castle)
Charles: Look, everyone, it's the ghost of the Black Knight.
Phineas: I guess he's still in search of the dragon.
(The Dragon falls onto the medieval festive)
Computer: To order a parachute, please call our help desk. Self-destruct in 3, 2, 1.
(As the dragon self destructs, Candace runs into it. The resulting explosion sends Candace into the castle, then crashing back down the tower, only to be caught by Charles)
Candace: Hi, Charles.
Grandpa Fletcher: Jolly good, old bean.
Phineas: Ah! There you are, Perry.
Lawrence: Hello. we had the most amazing time. Look! I found this 19th century barometer. Anything interesting happen 'round here?
(There's silence for a moment)
Ferb: I hear there's a new version of Jane Eyre in the offing.

Phineas: That would be awesome! (At Lawrence) Dad, can we-- (Lawrence is snoring; to Ferb) Come on, Ferb. We'll be back before he wakes up.
Candace: Oh, those bozos aren't pulling anything on my watch! (Candace follows them, only to get caught between the doors)
Phineas: Hey, Ferb. Where's Perry?

(Agent P enters a secret entrance and takes a vehicle; Major Monogram appears on the screen)
Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz is at it again. It appears that he's purchased a string of odd items: One pound of blood sausage- Ech, that's my grocery list. Here it is. One magnet, one map of the city's drainage pipes and 2 tons of scrap metal. It's in your hands now, Agent P. Over and out.

(At the theater's lobby...)
Phineas: Mr. Employee, sir, where's the mummy exhibit?
Employee: (Presses button) Manager assistance requested.
Employee #2: Yes?
Employee: These boys want to know where the mummy exhibit is.
Employee #2: It's in storage. In the basement.
Phineas: Guess who's goin' to the basement!
Woman: Uh, excuse me, where are the restrooms?
Employee: Manager assistance requested.
Employee #2: Yes?

Candace: There they go.
(The boys open the door to find...)
Phineas: Look! Pith helmets! We might be going the right way. Say something pithy.
Candace: That's it. I'm calling Dad.

(At the movie, Lawrence's cell phone vibrates)
Lawrence: (Laughs) Ohh!

(Back to Candace)
Candace: Oh, forget it! I'm going in myself. (knocks over a series of posts, which strike a gumball machine and cause the gumball container to come loose and roll after her. Candace enters the stairwell and steps in a mop bucket with wheels that's full of water and goes down the stairs)
Phineas: Did you hear that? Maybe it's the mummy.
Candace: (lands at the bottom of the stairway) Eww. My shoe is all squishy!
(The gumball container rolls toward the door, down the stairs and towards the boys. Ferb immediately gets on Phineas' shoulders)
Phineas: Uh, Ferb? What are you doing? (Ferb extends his arms out an grabs a pipe and they land on the gumball container) Woah! Who knew looking for mummies would be so much fun? Watch this! (They then do some tricks before ramming above the door) Ugh! (They land and watch the gumball container roll away) Hey, Ferb, this was our first booby trap! Woo! Hey, look! The storage! We're here!
(Back to Candace)
Candace: Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, when I catch them...
(She sees the gumball container coming and runs for it; she tries to go over the gumball container, but the pipe breaks, causing her to stare at the camera bemusedly; she tries again, but she lands in the overhead duct and comes out beat up) Oh, give me a break! (The gumball container then rolls past her, up the stairs and into the elevator; Candace sees this and walks away and gets into an elevator)
(Song: I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun! elevator music)
(Candace sees the gumball container in the elevator and runs out with the gumball in pursuit; she tries a couple of storage doors, but they're locked. Eventually the gumball container breaks and she rolls into a supplies closet)
Candace: Bubble gum? Oh, really old, stale bubble gum! Blaugh! (she inadvertently gets some butter and toilet paper on her and she walks out looking like a mummy) Phineas!

(At the dam, Doofenshmirtz is working on an inator; Perry surfaces)
Doofenshmirtz: Almost done, just this one more little bit! (Perry appears and kicks the paintbrush out of Doof's hand) Perry the Platypus! As usual, your timing is incredible! And by "Incredible", of course I mean: COMPLETELY CREDIBLE! (Laser fires trapping Perry in a ball) No use, Perry the Platypus! I made this out of something that cannot be penetrated! Pure evil! And a blend of space-age polymers. You see, Perry the Platypus, I'm going to unleash the water held by this dam into that huge drainage pipe that leads directly to the ocean. The additional water will raise the sea level by 2%, and then my property one block from the shoreline will become beachfront property! (Laughs maniacally) And to release the water from the dam, I've invented a ray, which attracts wood like it attracts metal: The Wood-inator! Which was almost complete until you rudely interrupted me. Oh, look at this, Perry. It's my paintbrush. You know, the one you knocked out of my hand a few moments ago. Maybe you want to take it back from me now, huh? Huh, you want to try? (Laughs) Goodbye, Perry the Platypus! (pushes Perry into the river)

(Cut back to the boys; they go in and approach a fake mummy)
Phineas: Owah Tagu Siam! (Phineas grabs the fake mummy and inadvertently pops it) There's nothing here but fakey promotional lobby junk. For all we know, there might not be such thing as a mummy. (At Mummy Candace) Yeah, I'll be right with you. I mean-- (Gasps)
Candace: Phineas!
Phineas: (Screams; Slams door)

[They evade Candace at different points of the room; finally they hide inside a Safari Man 2 in 3D stand-up display]
Phineas: Wow, I didn't expect them to be so scary. I mean, can you imagine the angry, twisted soul hidden under those bandages?
Candace: Phineas!
Phineas: Makes me shudder. But you know what? We came down here looking for a mummy, and I'm not leaving without one. Let's get him! (Egyptian Guitar Solo continues while the boys try to catch Candace; finally they catch her by enclosing her in a wooden Egyptian coffin.) Hey, Ferb. We got our own mummy! Now, how are we going to get it home?

(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: And... finished! (presses a button that picks up parts of the dam; one of the beavers sees Perry in the bubble. They chatter and the beaver takes a log and chews it down to a toothpick, but uses his own teeth to burst the bubble that has Perry trapped. They shake hands and slap tails and Perry runs back to the beaver dam)

(Cut back to the Woodenator)
Doofenshmirtz:It is working! (laughs) It is functioning properly! (Perry chatters, getting his attention; he gasps) Perry the Platypus? You defeated my bubble of pure evil? Ooh! (he traps himself and Perry in a bubble and land in the river just as the dam falls apart) Oh, no! What? (Perry uses Doofenshmirtz's nose to pop the bubble and escapes) Is my nose really that pointy?
(The river rolls all the way into a pipe that leads to the theater; Perry leaps out just as the hallway starts to flood; cut to the boys)
Phineas: You know what this is? Our second booby trap! (Water splashing; drifting the boys off with the coffin and Perry) There you are, Perry. (Perry chatters; they then go down a rapid) WOO-HOO-HOO! OH YEAH! (they then go up the rapid) WOO-HOO! (They burst through the roof) OH YEAH! (they land near the car; at Candace) Hey, Candace, you missed all the fun. Allow me to introduce our mummy. (realizes the "mummy" isn't there) Hey, where's our mummy? Mummy? Mummy?
Lawrence: Well, Mummy has supper waiting for us at home. (at Candace) Candace, why are you all wet?

Jeremy asked me if I could meet him at the fair later today next to the Ferris wheel.
Oh, no! I almost forgot I'm scared of heights! What am I going to do?
Linda: (Calling from downstairs) Candace, we're leaving now!
Candace: Mom, I'm having a teenage crisis!
Linda: Don't forget we're going bowling.
We need you to keep an eye on the boys.
Lawrence: Preferably two.
Phineas: Bowling? That sounds fun.
Hey, Dad, is it alright if we use that old lawn-bowling set?
Lawrence: Sure thing, boys! Knock yourselves out.
Linda: Toodles!

(Outside, in the backyard)
Phineas: You know, Ferb, with a few modifications, we could really zip up this old lawn-bowling set.
Baljeet: Hello, Phineas. What'you doing?
Ooh! I just sounded like Isabella.
Phineas: We're gonna build the world's biggest and best bowling-ball game!
Baljeet: Well, according to The Most Pointless Book of World Records...
(♪ Fanfare; a brief pause)

Phineas: Four feet? Ferb, we could beat that record in our sleep.
Baljeet: You know, the officials from The Most Pointless Book of World Records...
(♪ Fanfare)

Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P.
We've tracked Doofenshmirtz to an old abandoned warehouse, and he's made some suspicious purchases, 10,000 packets of powdered hot chocolate, a hotdog vendor's cart, a medium-sized parka, and a pair of red flannel long johns with a flap in the back.
Don't ask us how we know. Get out there and kick some Doofen-butt.

(Montage of Phineas and Ferb building a gigantic bowling ball.

Baljeet: Wow! That is one big bowling ball.
Phineas: Hey, look at that, Ferb! Told you we could do it in our sleep.

(Scene shifts to Candace's room)
Candace: So, what do you think I should wear to the fair tonight?
I'm thinking my favorite red blouse with my white skirt and red matching socks.
(Bowling pins crashing)
Candace: Stacy, I'm gonna have to call you back.

(In the backyard, the set of bowling pins crash again. Baljeet and Buford cheer)
Phineas: That was amazing!
Isabella: Wow, Phineas! Another strike!
Phineas: That makes four in a row! In your face, Buford!
Baljeet: Ha ha! Yes! What he said! In da face!
(Laughs) Uh-uh, I mean... You will get him next time. Clearly.
Phineas: Ferb, did you get that strike?
(Ferb gives a thumb up then pushes the "Reset" button)

Phineas: Who's next?
Candace: Phineas, just what do you think you're doing out here?
Phineas: Candace, you're just in time. It's your turn.
Candace: Just wait until Mom hears about...
Then again, you guys always seem to make everything disappear before Mom gets home.
But if I take the evidence to her at the Bowl-A-Rama, then she'll have to believe me!

(Candace daydreams)
Linda: Oh, Candace, you were right about Phineas and Ferb this whole time.
We should've believed you.
Lawrence: And just to express how sorry we are, here's my credit card.
You have our permission to ruin us financially.
Jeremy: Candace, that is so cool how you busted your brothers like that!
Will you marry me?
(Daydream ends)

Phineas: So, you wanna give it a try?
Candace: I do, Jeremy, I mean, uh... I'd love to give it a try!
Phineas: All right. I'll show you how it works.

(Candace and Phineas inside of the giant bowling ball)
Phineas: Well, first of all, the cockpit's on a gyroscope so it stays level.
Here's your monitor, and this is the trackball you use to steer.
Now, no matter what, never hit the gyro stabilizer lock button! It'll disable the gyroscope, and you'll spin around like a greased pig on roller skates.
Candace: Yeah, yeah, use the trackball. Don't hit the button. I got it!
Phineas: All right. You seem to know what you're doing.
Candace: Do I ever?
This is a piece of cake.
Bowl-R-Ama, here I come!
Phineas: Okay, Candace, try to take it slow at first!
(The ball takes off at warp speed)
Candace: (laughs hysterically as she controls the ball)
(The ball hits the pins)
Phineas: Way to go, Candace!
(The ball rolls over Ferb's table and away)
Where's she going?

♪ Doofenshmirtz Abandoned Self Storage! ♪
(Perry swings into the abandoned self storage via grappling hook. After landing on a metallic ledge, he looks around suspiciously, only to end up getting frozen by a giant robotic penguin.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus. Right on time. It seems like you've got quite a chill there!
I want you to meet my latest creation: the Giant Robotic Penguin Icy-Freeze-Your-Socks-Off Breath-inator...thingy!
First, I will unleash my giant penguins at the fair today, so they may begin freezing the entire city!
Then I will sell all the citizens of Danville my organic, yet highly addictive, Doof brand hot chocolate. Because, you know, who doesn't enjoy a nice cup of hot chocolate when it's so cold out? The first cup will be free, of course. But then the second... will also be free. But then the third... will cost a million dollars! That way, I only have to sell three, and I will already be a millionaire.
So, Perry the Platypus, as they say in Mexico, dos svidanya! Down there, that's two vidanyas.

Phineas: She's headed for the Bowl-A-Rama!
Candace: (laughs hysterically)

Linda: You know, dear, Candace hasn't called.
Lawrence: Oh, don't worry. I'm sure the kids are having a ball.

Phineas: Ooh! That's gotta hurt.
(The ball rolls through a construction sight, inside, the trackball comes loose)
Candace: Oh, no!
(The ball falls down a hole and goes through a pipe)
Phineas: So where does this lead?
Construction Worker: Huh. Heck if I know.
Phineas: Ferb, the map of Danville's underground.

Narrator: And now, back to "Neanderthal: The Pride of the Paleolithic". The Neanderthals were great makers of tools, as well as skilled hunters. It's also believed that they had a highly advanced language. For example: (The narrator imitates the language of the Neanderthal)
Narrator: ...Is how they may have said "I love you" or "Please take out the trash". But one day, the fateful ice storms came. The Neanderthals blamed each other for being ill-equipped to survive the harsh cold. Many were frozen in glaciers and may be preserved to this very day. We will return to our program after a brief word from our sponsor.

Look at his cute little hat. Anyway, the whole thing sickens me to no end, which is why I created the Sandwich Remove-Inator It sucks all sandwich suits up into the air and then shreds them to teensy, weensy pieces.

(Candace still stares shocked at what she saw. A bird knocks the cardboard down revealing the real Mount Rushmore)
Candace: Huh?
Phineas: Now! (Phineas and Ferb swing on ropes, revealing a hideous looking Candace statue. Candace is still shocked)
Phineas: (long pause) Oops.
(Ferb hammers a rock, the hideous statue crumbles, revealing a proper Candace statue. Briefly, Candace is still shocked, but it turns into happiness)
Candace: Huh? (tears up, sobs) Why it's... (sobs) i-it's...IIIIIT'S BEAUUUUTIFULLLL...! (sobs) MOOOOOM!!! (runs off)

(Candace runs down the stairs)
Candace: Mom! (trips) I've gotta show you something right now! (drags her) Come on! Follow me!
Linda: Candace, are you still trying to get the boys in trouble?
Candace: No! No, no, this is a great thing! Oh, it's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me!
Linda: (tries to climb the stairs) You know, Candace, this is the second time I've climbed up there! I'm already down half a dress size!
Candace: Come on! Hurry!

(Cut to the Drill-inator, it bursts out of the "nose" on the Candace statue)
Doofenshmirtz: AAH! (Perry locks the Drill-inator's target onto the Old Reliable Geyser and jumps off)
Wait, where are you going? AAH! (The Drill-inator lands on the geyser) I'm okay, I -- (spins around and gets flung away) AAH! Fie upon you, Perry the Platypuuuuus!
(Perry parachutes down to safety)

(Cut back to Candace)
Candace: Hurry, Mom! You won't believe it!
(Spots of lava form on the statue)
...Huh?
(Lava bursts out of the spots on the statue)
(Gasps) Ewwwww!
(More lava bursts out, Candace gets shocked. The statue explodes as an orchestra plays music to match the feeling and Phineas and Ferb roast hot dogs on the lava. Water from the geyser spurts out from under the Drill-inator at the lava, cooling it)

(Candace's expression changes to depression, Linda makes her perfectly timed entrance) Linda: Whew! Finally made it, honey! Now, what is it you wanted me to see?
Candace: Bu...bu...!
(Camera shows the lava smoke vanishing, revealing the normal monument, no Candace statue and all)
Linda: You're right! It's beautiful! (hugs her) Happy birthday, honey. (Kisses Candace's cheek) Now let's go find your father. (Linda walks away, the camera zooms in on a saddened Candace)

Candace: Ugh! (bangs her head on the iron rod)
(Phineas and Ferb come over)
Phineas: Did ya like your birthday present?
Candace: Uh-huh, uh... (walks away)
Ferb: Well, it was definitely better than the gorilla in the cake.

(Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Candace: Isn't today great? Today is such a great day! Everything is so great!
Linda: My, Candace, what's got you in such a good mood?
Candace: Jeremy asked me to go play croquet with him in the park!
Lawrence: Okay, well, be sure to be home in time for the barbecue. We're gonna be watching Kermillian's Comet fly past the Earth.
Phineas: A comet? Cool!
Lawrence: It only comes around every seventy three and a half years.
Linda: We'll be barbecuing steaks for the whole neighborhood! Why don't you bring Jeremy?
Candace: You had me at "steaks"!
Phineas: Why is it called Kermillian's Comet, Dad?
Lawrence: Kermillian's Comet was named after an ancient Danville astronomer, Augustus Kermillian, who discovered the comet.
Linda: It's also been said that if you wish on a comet, your wish will come true.
Phineas: Wow! Come on, Ferb. I know what we're gonna do today!
Lawrence: By the way, where is Perry?

Major Monogram: (Talking throughout the Flynn-Fletcher's television set) Agent P, (Perry puts on his fedora) Sorry to disturb you, but we have an emergency. We've just been informed that all steaks in the Tri-State area have disappeared. This has Doofenshmirtz written all over it. Go lay your smack-down on him, Agent P. The fate of the world rests entirely in your hands.
Lawrence: (Walking into the living room) What, the fate of the world?
Major Monogram: Uh, welcome to our telethon. If you're just joining us, your dollars are helping us to find a cure for, um... antidisestablishmentarianism.
Lawrence: Goodness me, that sounds dreadful!
Major Monogram: Oh, it is. It, um, makes you look pale and weak, (He shows Carl) like this young lad.
Lawrence: Oh dear, the poor thing. Look at that. Wait a minute. Antidisestablishmentarianism? That's more of an ideological stance than a disease. Isn't it?
Major Monogram: Uh, well, look at that. (He hides Carl) Seems they just found a cure. Thanks to all the viewers who donated. Bye now.
(Monogram cuts the feed)
Linda: Honey, you ready to go?
Lawrence: Yeah, sure. Hey, did you know they've just found a cure for antidisestablishmentarianism?
Linda: Great. I can finally take off this puce ribbon.

Isabella: Ooh, that sounds like fun.
Phineas: We're gonna put on a laser light show and, as a grand finale, we're gonna laser our faces into the comet. That way, when it comes back in seventy-three and a half years, we can all show our grandchildren. Oh, yeah, my parents are cooking steaks for everyone.

Doofenshmirtz: One moment, please. ... (Doofenshmirtz comes out wearing two steaks as glasses) Perry the Platypus? What are you looking at? ... Oh, these. Yes, these are my latest invention - steak specs. I came up with the idea after your last little visit. (Doofenshmirtz shows Perry his black eye) With these on, you don't have to constantly hold a piece of steak to your black eye. See? See?... I plan on mass-producing these. I'll make millions. Let me show you. (He shows Perry a containment unit for all the steaks) I've stolen all the steaks in the Tri-State Area, and I keep them here in my steak containment unit or SCU (Pronounced skʰʌ), for short, or maybe it should be SCU (Pronounced skʰu). ... I'm a little on the fence about - Wait. What are you doing? (Perry pulls down a she, revealing an -inator) Oh, that? That's just a giant heat ray in case I want to do something evil later.

Jeremy: Candace, what happened?
Candace: There were so many of 'em. The horror, the horror.
Jeremy: Maybe you should sit down. So what happened again?

Thank you. (To Ferb) All right, Ferb, that's everyone. Kill the lights. Space - it's really big. It's filled with planets of all shapes and sizes and millions of shiny stars. Space has also got huge comets soaring through it, including one named after the ancient Danville astronomer Kermillian.
Candace: (Arriving home, and seeing the observatory) What's going on? ... Phineas.
Phineas: And now, behold - Kermillian's Comet. ... Commence laser-engraving sequence.

Calmly head towards the exits in a calm, orderly– (A large piece of rubble lands near Phineas. He gets startled by this and realizes how he could've easily gotten hurt.) Okay, now you can panic.

Ooh, something smells delicious. (The top of Doofenshmirtz's building explodes sending steaks flying) Curse you, Perry the Platypus.

Linda: (Arriving home) I can't believe we drove around the whole city and couldn't find one steak.
Candace: (Candace then runs outside in her normal outfit) Mom, they used a laser to carve their faces in the comet.
Lawrence: Candace, I don't see anything.
Candace: No, no, no.You could only see it from their observatory. Come on, come on. See?
(Candace walks into the backyard and stares deadpanned. Linda and Lawrence walk in as well)
Lawrence: Well, I don't see an observatory.
Linda: Sorry, everyone! We looked all over town, and we couldn't find any steaks.
(Everyone is disappointed)
Buford: Oh, man. I even brought my own plate!
Lawrence: At least we can all enjoy Kermillian's Comet together.
Phineas: Yeah, before it disappears for another seventy three and a half years.
Candace: (runs up to them) Just wait! When I'm eighty-eight, you will be so busted! (runs off)
Ferb: Actually, you'd be eighty-eight and a half.
Candace: (offscreen) Whatever!
Lawrence: So, honey, make a wish.
Linda: I wish we had steaks.
Buford: Yeah, me too.

Candace: You mean you came over to check on me?
Jeremy: Of course.

Jeremy: So, that's Kermillian's Comet. Did you make a wish?
Candace: Yes.
Jeremy: And did it come true?

Hildegard: I thought I smelled the last of you back in '57, when I whipped your sorry behind, took the trophy and became the rightful Queen of the Derby!
Phineas: Whoa, Grandma, you were in the rollerskating derby?
Betty Jo: Not only was I in it, I was champ! It was years ago. (Flashback)
Betty Jo: (Narrating) The night of the final match between the Bombers and the Slashers. We were on our final lap. What was left of my team used our signature move "The Whip" to send me to the finish line. Hildegard's team had the same idea. The trophy was mine until...
(the young Hildegard punches Betty Jo, and crosses the finish line first)
(Flashback ends)
Betty Jo: You only won because you cheated!
Hildegard: "Anything goes", remember?
Betty Jo: Well, what do you say we try it again, cheater?
Hildegard: Anytime, anywhere.

Candace: That's your grandmother?
Hildegard: Come on, Jeremy. You and your little sister are on my team. Suzy!
Suzy: Yes, Grandma?
Hildegard: Me, you and Jeremy are a team. Got it?
Betty Jo: So I need two of you kids on my team, okay?
Candace: Well, you can have Phineas and Ferb, Grandma. I'm not–
Suzy: But it's not fair, Candace. Our team has two girls and one boy, so you need to be on your grandma's team so it's fair. Cause it's not fair if it's two boys and one girl against two girls and one boy, so you have to skate, Candace, or else it won't be fair.
Phineas: Then it's you, Ferb, and Grandma! You'll make a great team!
Candace: B-But–
Jeremy: I guess it's set, then. We gotta do it for our grandmas. Right, Candace?
Candace: Yeah, (She chuckles) right.
Suzy: Psst. See ya on the track, chump!
Candace: Yeah, great. Hey, wait! There's nowhere to have a rollerskating derby, remember? The old derby track got torn down and turned into a tattoo parlor!
Phineas: Leave the rink to us!

Candace: Glue gun? What are they up to? Later, Stace. I knew it! I just knew you would be up to something by now. Et tu, Grandpa?

Phineas: Yeah.
Clyde: Ooh, yeah.
Doofenshmirtz: Will you cool it with the noise, Perry the Platypus? I've got a splitting headache. I was at this evil mixer until late last night, it was crazy. Can you hang out for just one moment? I'm almost there. Hold on. (Doofenshmirtz presses a button, and a cage falls on Perry) Ow! Oh, I've got to get a quieter trap. Now that you're trapped, I will tell you my evil plan. I'm miserable because I can't grow facial hair. It all started when I was about 15. (He begins to flashback, but then stops) Oh, you know, my head hurts too much for a flashback. Anyway, I've tried everything to grow facial hair. It's all so painful. I hate people with beards, et cetera, et cetera. So, who do they erect a statue of right next door? Rutherford B. Hayes, our 19th president! Only the president with the best facial hair of all! Just look at that thing. There's no beard like 19th century beard, Perry the Platypus. Anyway, that horrible statue must be destroyed as it is a constant reminder follicular failure! Oh. Give me just a moment, Perry. This hurts me more that it hurts you. Literally.

(Cut to the Roller Derby)
Betty Jo: ...And then on the final lap, we'll use The Whip to send the weak skater. (to Candace) No offense, honey, but that's you. Over to the finish line—To victory!
Stacy: All I know for sure is boys hate to be beaten by girls. (In Candace's fantasy)
(Hildegard sobs)
Jeremy: Candace! Have you no mercy?! Come on, Grandma. Let's go home.

Betty Jo: And remember, honey, show 'em no mercy!
Candace: What am I going to do? I can't beat Jeremy's grandmother. And I can't let my grandmother lose.

Candace: All right, all right, we've had our kicks. But Mom's still gonna flip when she sees this. (A car door shuts) That's her car! You are so busted! (she skates into the house)
(The Bread-inator hits the roller rink, turning into a giant loaf of bread)
Candace: (coming out of the house) Mom, come on, come on! The boys built a giant roller rink in the backyard– uh...giant loaf of bread?
Phineas: (in the same intonation as "I don't know") Ah 'unno.
Candace: (skates back inside) Moooom Mom! The boys built a giant loaf of bread in the backyard!
Linda: (inside the house) What? I thought you said it was a roller rink.
(The magpies eat the bread)
Candace: It was, but now it's a loaf of bread! (skates back out) Come on, come on! See?! (stops to see that the bread is gone)
Linda: (comes out with Lawrence) Candace, what are you talking about?!
Candace: B-b-b...bread...
Linda: (at Phineas and Ferb) Boys, I think she's finally lost it.
Phineas: Hey, Dad. How'd your speech go?
Lawrence: Well, I have to say it was "thimbly" wonderful.
Phineas: Hey, what's this thing do?
(Phineas presses the button on Suzy's remote)
Candace: Wha–? (Candace is launched off)
Jeremy: Hey, guys. Candace around?
(Jeremy catches Candace as she rockets into his arms)
Ferb: Good catch, Jeremy.
Candace: (She giggles) He sure is.

(Scene opens up showing a van driving up a hill.)
Phineas: Hey, we're almost there. What's the first thing you're going to do at camp, Buford?
Buford: Find a nerd, take his underpants, and run 'em up the flagpole.
Phineas: I don't think Camp Phineas and Ferb has a flagpole.
Buford: Then I guess I'll just find a nerd and take his underpants.
Baljeet: You may have my underpants. They just got very messy all of a sudden.
Buford: Thanks, but it ain't the same if Buford don't rip 'em off of you.
Phineas: What about you, Isabella?
Isabella: The Fireside Girls and I are going to work on our accomplishment patches.
Fireside Girls: Yay! Accomplishment patches!
Phineas: How about you, sis? What's the first thing you're gonna do at camp?
Candace: First of all, it's not camp. It's just Grandma and Grandpa's cabin, and it's boring.
Phineas: But we made T-shirts.
Candace: Secondly, I don't like the outdoors, okay? I don't like bugs. Phineas, are you even listening to me?
Phineas: I seem to have misplaced my ant farm.
Candace: Mom!
Linda: Yes, Candace?
Candace: Do I have to go to Grandma and Grandpa's?
Lawrence: Oh, I think it's rather sweet the Grandma Betty Jo and Grandpa Clyde invite you kids and all your friends every year.
Candace: But I'm not a kid. I'm a young adult. Can I do something with you guys?
Linda: Of course you can, Dear. You can join us at the antiques symposium. This year's keynote address will debate Shellac vs. Lacquer.
Lawrence: Woo-hoo!
Candace: I'll take one of those shirts. (Sobs)

(Cut to the cabin)
Grandpa Clyde: Where are they?
Grandma Betty Jo: Look. Oh, here they are now.
Grandpa Clyde: (Laughs) Hey!
Phineas: Hiya, Grandpa!
Grandpa Clyde: Well, hello Phineas! You haven't changed a bit!
Phineas: Grandpa, that's not me! That's Perry!
Grandpa Clyde: Huh? Huh? Oh, right. Looks like I need to get my glasses fixed!
Phineas: (Laughs) With the glasses.
Grandpa Clyde: And Turbo Ferb-o! Put 'er there, put 'er there, put 'er there, put 'er there, put 'er there, put 'er there! (Laughs) Still a man of a few words, I see.
Ferb: Well, actually I--
Grandpa Clyde: So, where's your sister?

(Cut to Candace)
Candace: Hello? Hello! What do you have to do to find a cell signal in this place?
Grandma Betty Jo: Candace?
Candace: Oh, hi Grandma. How can you stand living out here in the middle of nowhere?
Grandma Betty Jo: Oh, come on, honey. It's not so bad. You'll see.
Grandpa Clyde: Alright, nature lovers! Time for vittles!
Phineas: (Laughs) "Vittles" is "Grandpa-ese" for "food". Hey, where's Perry?

(Agent P knocks on the door, and goes down the secret entrance with webs to his lair and saves a flower vase)
Major Monogram: Sorry about that, Agent P. We haven't used that tree slide in years. Not since I was at... the Academy. (Sad music) Anyway, Doofenshmirtz seems to be up to something, Agent P. He's hold up at his evil woodland retreat. You're mission is to find out what he's up to. Please, Agent P. Be careful. (Thinking) The Academy.
Kid: But I don't want to go to the Academy, Daddy.
Man: I'm not your father, it's been decided.
Kid: I love you, Daddy.

(Kids shouting and laughing; pans to Candace)
Candace: Oh, quiet, you pesky bugs! I am trying to tan here!
Phineas: Hey, Candace. I thought I'd bring my favorite camp counselor a Phineas special.
Candace: That is just a glass of limeade. And I am not a counselor.
Isabella: Hey, Phineas. The girls have finished pitching the tents. (The Fireside Girls salute in front of their tents) Can you sign here for our Tent Pitching achievement patches?
Phineas: Sure thing.
Candace: What are you doing?
Phineas: Well, as camp director, I'd say I'm "Doing my job".
Grandpa Clyde: Gather around, kids. There's an old legend, well, not that I believe it, about the Sasquatch. A race of giant, hairy creatures living up here in these very woods. (Kids gasp) If my memory serves, I think there was a song written about it.
Isabella: Really? Do you remember any of it?

Grandma Betty Jo: There's all sort of fun a young adult can have here. You just gotta use your imagination. So come on! We're making stick figures! Out of real sticks!
Candace: Grandma!

Doofenshmirtz: (Laughs) Tonight! It all happens tonight! (he sees Perry) Perry the Platypus! How unexpected! And by unexpected, I mean: (Record scratch) Unexpected. What are you doing here? This is my week off. (Perry stares at the dinner table) Oh, that. (Laughs) Well, uh, well, I suppose you should know I- I've started dating again. I met someone online.

Doofenshmirtz: No, no! (Laughs) Uh, that would be me. I'm Strudelcutie4427. Nice to meet you. Uh, this is my pet platypus. He was just going outside for a nightly walk.

Grandpa Clyde: Oh, Phineas, you always start. Why not give another kid a chance?
Grandma Betty Jo: Yes. How about you, Candace?
Candace: No.
Grandpa Clyde: Okay. Anyone else? Uh, Baljeet?
Baljeet: W-what? Uh, uh, oh. Thank you. (Flashlight switch flips; Wolf howls) Well, this is a story about a kid who comes to this country, and goes to camp. He, like, has to share a tent with a bully. It's really quite terrifying, actually. Quite terrifying.
(Crickets chirp; Flashlight switch flips)
Grandpa Clyde: Take it away, Phineas.
Phineas: All right, Grandpa. I've got a good one. It's about Bigfoot!
Dimitri Popaunicolas/Pedro/Ginger: Bigfoot?
Buford: Bigfoot?
Squirrel: Bigfoot?
Candace: Grandma!
Grandma Betty Jo: Sorry, dear.

Woman: You are the cutest thing I've ever seen. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Doofenshmirtz: You know, some people say we look alike.
Woman: Uh, I don't think so. (At Perry) Not at all. No, not at all.
Doofenshmirtz: Uh, darling, you haven't even touched your cucumber water. I made it especially for you.

Doofenshmirtz: (Sips cucumber water, Spits it out) Oh, I don't even like cucumbers! Why do I always get the crazies?

(Back to the campfire)
(Wolf howls)
Phineas: And when the moon is full, like it is tonight, Bigfoot will return, and exact his revenge. (Leaves rustling) Huh? What was that noise?
(All gasping and screaming)
Baljeet: I really should have packed more underpants...
(The kids continue to scream endlessly in fear and terror. Doofenshmirtz hears their hollers.)
Doofenshmirtz: (Gasps) That sounded like screaming children! But it's not my birthday. (He falls off the balcony screaming; cut back to the campfire) Phineas: You guys crack me up! (Laughing)
Isabella: Phineas, what are you talking about?
Phineas: There's no Bigfoot! It's just Ferb in the tree! Look! See? They're just dummies! (At Ferb) Nice rope skills, my friend!
Isabella: Then... who is this?
Phineas: Ah, it's an inflatable Ferb. (Air hissing) Sounds like Ferb too.
Buford: That was awesome!

Grandpa Clyde: Candace, Honey, calm down!

Candace: A real Bigfoot. Oh, give it a rest, Phineas! Everyone knows that there's no such thing as a real- (sees Bigfoot behind her) Oh, fine. What's this one made of? Popsicle sticks and glitter?

Grandma Betty Jo: See you next year, Lorraine. (At Candace) Oh, come on. Let's round up those scared kids and have some hot cocoa.

Doofenshmirtz: It's not the worst date I've ever had. There was that one that kept stabbing me with a fork. Get this off of-- (sees the Bigfoot dummies and runs for it)

(Back at the cabin)
Candace: (Laughs) I sure got you guys! You should have seen your faces! Only unsophisticated, immature brains would believe in monsters. (Laughs) Yes, it takes a mature, such as myself, to know that there's... no such... thing... as... (Stammering) BIGFOOT! (she screams and runs inside; the other kids look but see nothing)
Baljeet: Oh, I do not believe her one bit. Too much overacting.
Kids: Yeah.
Buford: I smell ham.
Phineas: Hey, Perry. Why are you all covered in lipstick?

(Episode starts inside the garage at the Flynn-Fletcher house. Here, Buford and Isabella play foosball.)
Buford: Prepare to feel the wrath of Buford.
Isabella: Don't bring that smack-talk around here. This is my house!
Phineas: Technically, this is our garage.
Ferb: She's on a roll.

Stacy: No, wait! Just wear a hat.
Candace: Yeah! A hat! ..... How's this?
Stacy: Well, your hair looks better.
Candace: Yeah, but the strap is cutting off my... (the hat rips off) I'm gonna need something stronger.

Buford: Alright! This is the tie-breaker.
Isabella: I thought the last two were.
Buford: Nah. It's this one.
Isabella: Tell you what I'm going to do, Buford.
I'm going take this ball and I'm going hit into your goal in one shot.
Buford: Oh, is that right?
Isabella: Absolutely, and you want to know the funny part?
There's nothing you can do about it!
Buford: Bring it!

Isabella: Ain't that how it works, Buford?
Phineas: Wow. Nice foosing, Isabella.
Isabella: Thanks.

Candace: (appears)
You guys are making such a racket that I can't focus.

Jeremy: Hey, Candace.
Candace: Hello, Jeremy. Ha.
Jeremy: You look sporty.
Candace: Oh, you like it?
Jeremy: Well, that's perfect.
(holds up a camera) The sport shoot.
Buford: Well, that didn't really count, 'cause it's just a dainty little girls' game.
Isabella: It could be the biggest game in the world, and girls could still beat boys.
(pauses)
Biggest game in the world. Did you get that, Phineas?
Phineas: Yeah, we're on it.
(at Ferb) Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.
Buford: Great.
It's boys against girls.
And to give ya a fair shot, I'll even take Shrimpy here.
Baljeet: I am honored.
Buford: So, who's on your team?
Isabella: Candace, can you be on the girls' team with me?
Candace: Isabella, I'm a little busy right...
Jeremy: Perfect. Real action shots. Oh, you'll look great.
Candace: Really? OK, I'm in.
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?

(Inside the house, Perry walks to the bookshelf and then puts on his fedora. He then presses a button revealing an entrance with caution tape and a note from Monogram saying it's out of order and to use an alternate entrance. He holds the note, looks at the camera with a raised eyebrow, and then walks away. He goes to a door, which Perry opens. The camera pans down to show the stairs.)

My father said the dog was like the son he never had and named him Only Son.
Only Son became an award-winning show dog, bringing my father fame and fortune, while I was forced to be the lawn gnome.
Y-You remember that story, right, with my neighbor, Kenny?
I don't have to go through - OK.

So, to recap, my entire fragile self-esteem is totally dependent on your performance today at the dog show, but, you know, no pressure.

Lawrence: Guys, come and look at this. This is an actual replica of an artist's interpretation of what some random guy of no significance believed that the chariot of Asparagus might have looked like. And this is Asparagus, the greatest warrior in all of Greece. With this golden chariot, he would win every race. And here he is defeating the Minotaur, a creature that's half-man, half-bull. Asparagus defeated him using the head of Medusa, a creature so ugly she could turn people to stone with just one look.
Phineas: Kind of reminds me of Candace.

The platypus is one of our greatest friends in nature, a humble but key component in Mother Nature's delicate cycle of life. But as of late, worldwide populations have been declining to near endangerment. But why? Who is the enemy of the platypuses or... Well, you know what I mean.
Teen: This is the best platypus movie I have ever seen. (Slurping)
Narrator: Historically, the enemies of the platypus were well known: the poisonous swamp viper, the snaggle-tooth badger, and duplicating imitable stunts seen on television. But there is a new enemy of the platypus, one whose tireless development paves over the platypus's woodland homes: The greatest enemy of the platypus...is man.
Cheerful male voice: Hi, there.
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, you see, Perry the Platypus? For years I've been trying to rid myself of you with traps and bombs and poisonous gas and automatic tennis ball machines. I--I don't even know what I was thinking back then, but now I have the ultimate platypus elimination weapon. Perry the Platypus, recoil in horror at my new creation! A giant...killer...robot...man.
Giant Robot Man: My name is Norm. The enemy of the platypus is man.
Doofenshmirtz: Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Male teen: This is awesome! I did not know this movie was in 3-D.
Norm: Please, stop running. Perhaps we could discuss our differences over coffee.

(In the backyard...)
Phineas: Okay, we're all set! Let's meet our racers. In the first chariot is us. Then we got Isabella and the Fireside Girls, Buford and Baljeet, and we have one for Candace, too, if she ever shows up. Here are the maps for everyone. The first chariot to reach the museum wins. Any questions?
Baljeet: Yes. Should we not establish the rules first?
Buford: This is a chariot race. There are no rules.
Isabella: No rules? Well, if those are the rules!
Buford: Hey, you, you're goin' down!
Baljeet: But we're on the same team.
Buford: Then you're goin' down with me!
Phineas: Each chariot will be pulled by a rocking horse Ferb souped up with a lawnmower engine!
Candace: Phineas! Just what do you think you're doing?
Phineas: Candace, great! You're right on time! Check out this cool-lookin' helmet we made for you! And we built you your own chariot that looks just like you!
Candace: Oh, that's ridiculous. I do not have wheels!

(In the living room...)
Actor: To the winner of this race, I offer the spoils of the empire…
Candace: Dad, they're racing chariots.

Candace: Dad!
Lawrence: Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want some?
Candace: (Groans in frustration) That's it! I'll stop this myself.

Aah! Daddy!

Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa, take a look out that window and tell me what you see.
Vanessa: Uh, not much.
Doofenshmirtz: Exactly! Ever since that stupid billboard went up, my panoramic view is completely ruined. I used to have this perfect vantage point for enjoying the delicious misery of others.

Candace: Mom, Mom! Hurry!! Come on, come on!!!
Linda: Hi, kids. How are you doing?
Candace: Huh?
Phineas: We're just about to make a nice handmade sundae for Isabella.
Linda: Oh, that is so sweet! Come on in the kitchen. I'll help you with it.

(In Isabella's room, Isabella is presented with a normal sized ice cream sundae.)
Isabella: Wow, guys, this is amazing! I was afraid you guys were gonna go overboard and build some giant sundae contraption or something!

Phineas: Hey, Ferb. Snap out of it. What happened back there?
Ferb: (pause) I was weak.
(Episode starts with Phineas and Ferb under a tree in the Backyard of the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Phineas: And the candidates for what awesome thing we will do today are: our blueprint for completely food-based water park, your schematic for the tunnel to the center of the Earth, this model for the chamber of invisibility, your other schematic for a microscopic zoo that rests on the head of a pin. Gee. We sure have lots of blueprints, models, and schematics. ("Morning Mood" by Edvard Grieg as Phineas notices a falling leaf) Hey, Ferb. Summer doesn't last forever, and we've got too many plans for just the two of us. We either need more days of summer, or more of us. (Ferb shows Phineas a blueprint) What's this? The blueprint for that robot we invented? Ferb, you're a genius! We can make android versions of ourselves! We can make Phinedroids and Ferbots! Hey, where's Perry?

Major Monogram: Agent P, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. He's made 57 phone calls in the past hour. We don't know to whom, or why. (Perry points toward the chimney vator) No, not to Santa. Agent P, your mission is to find out what Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to and stop him. See, Carl, that's why I don't like using the chimney vator. Besides, that guy totally owes me a pony from when I was five.

[In the garage of the house]
Phineas: Okay, Ferb. The robot building device is almost ready to be activated. Just a couple more commands. (Computer beeping) Okay, pictures please.
Computer: Phineas. Ferb. Phineas and Ferb.
Phineas: Here we go.
Computer: Robot building sequence activated.

Phineas: Wow, it worked! I'm so glad we tried our new android building device instead of using that old dinosaur. (Beep; The door on the unit opens up, several Phineas and Ferb-like robots march out; on bullhorn) Phinedroids and Ferbots, we thank you for being with us today.

I've—I left, like, 57 messages and, I won't leave anymore. It starts to look a little desperate. (Perry glares) Hmm? Oh, no, that's not an evil scheme. That's just a giant magnet. I'm going to wave it over my girlfriend's house and erase all the messages I left. (Laughs) Because, some of them are long and rambly. I know, there's an ordinance against it, but... What?

Linda: That's nice, honey. Well, the pictures should be ready soon, and then I'll see the robots when I get home. Bye. (Phone beeps)
Candace: Everything will be gone once Mom gets home. Isn't that right, Mr. Miggins? Unless... (Candace grabs a sack, an oil can, and a football helmet which she puts on, and lays a trap for a Brobot; a Ferbot walks near the oil can and drinks from it; Candace leaps from the cellar and traps the Ferbot) Aha! (She carries the sack with the Ferbot in it to the front yard and calls Stacy) Stacy? Oh my gosh! Guess what? Ugh, Stacy, I can't understand you. Why are you crying? Yeah. Crying, crying, it hurts, right. Got that. Uh-huh, Oh, hi, Mrs. Hirano! What? Stacy got her ears pierced? Gee, what a terrible thing that I had completely no idea about! Anyway, gotta run, Mrs. Hirano. Give Stacy my best! (Throughout this, a garbage truck arrives. A man takes the bag with the Ferbot in it and tosses it into the dump area. It drives away, and a Fred's Fertilizer truck pulls up. A man drops off a bag of fertilizer and the truck drives off. Candace barely notices; she walks back to the bag and kicks it) Poor, mixed-up Stacy.

(At Ferb) Hey, normally I'd be saying that to you, Ferb. Just kinda weird saying that to a Ferbot. Come on. Let's see how the Microscopic zoo is going. (At Robots) Hey, guys. Mind if we see how things are coming along? (At Ferb) Hold her steady, Ferb. Wow! That's amazing! And according to this microscopic newspaper machine, the zoo's really packing them in! Well, I guess we can categorize this project as a success. Hey, that's the best tunnel to the center of the Earth I've ever seen. Boy, I bet that was fun to build. You know, Ferb, even if these robots were a success and completely on model, I kind of miss working on stuff. You know, just you and me. Hey, what's this? Thanks. Hovercraft lounge chair? We were gonna build that next week! Oh, no! The Phinedroids and Ferbots are running out of projects, so they're designing their own! Have we learned nothing from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein? Oh, look! They're starting their own overpriced coffee franchise! That's so '90s. (Cut back to Candace sitting on the sidewalk in front of the house) This is terrible! (cut back to Phineas and Ferb) We have an entirely new problem! (Camera pans across the robots getting out of controls) The coffee's making them haywire! And that one's having trouble falling asleep. (Camera shows a Phinedroid trying to sleep, looking to an alarm clock every 2 seconds) Poor little guy. (Robot whirring) That's it! You guys are drinking way too much coffee! I'm shutting her down! (He slams the metal curtain of the coffee shop shut, The robots turn towards he and Ferb evilly and their eyes glow) Well, that's no good. Time to show these robots who's in charge.

Linda: Candace, why on earth are you all covered in mud?
Ferb: Because she's a tire-spinning, gear-grinding, clutch-burning, backfiring, paint-trading, red-lining, overheating, throttle-stomping truck drivin' girl.
Candace: And I learned how to parallel park!
Linda: Great!

[This episode mostly takes place in the Danville Museum of Natural History]
Lawrence: Hey, you know, kids, these fossils are of creatures that lived here in Danville millions of years ago.
Linda: Lucky these things aren't here today.
Candace: No, lucky would be if we weren't still here today.
Lawrence: Oh, look. This T-Rex footprint was found not 30 yards from this very spot. Hey, it says here that this fossil was dug up right near our very own neighborhood.
Phineas: Didn't we have a dog named Bucky who got sick and went to live on kindly Old Man Simmons' farm?
Lawrence: Oh, uh, let's move on, shall we?
This exhibit is kindly Old Man Simmons—
Hey! Who's up for milkshakes?
Phineas: Hmm?
[Angelic chorus]
Ferb taps on his shoulder as Phineas looks over. Suddenly, his eyes get huge.] "Gadgets Through the Ages". This exhibit was made for us, Ferb.
Hey, what are all those people looking at?
Tour Guide: And this is one of our curious pieces, a time machine made by a 19th-century scientist named Xavier Onassis. But, of course, we know he never finished it, or else we'll still see him here today.
(Laughs) Right? Right? Eh, anyone? All right. Moving on.
Phineas: A time machine, huh?
Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!
[Ferb pulls out a screwdriver]
Right. Let's fix us a time machine.
Hey, where's Perry?

[Suspense music; Snapshots]
[Camera pans to Major Monogram, then Perry, then back to Monogram, then back to Perry, who waves his arms.]
Perry: (Arms waving)
Carl: Uh, Agent P?
Hey, it's me: Carl. The intern?
We got a bit of a situation here.
Major Monogram has been frozen like this pretty much all day. Solid as a rock. Oh, sorry. Anyhow, if the Major were able to, I'm sure he'd say, well, "Ouch", first of all, am I right?
(Laughs) But seriously, I'm sure he'd say "Doofenshmirtz was up to something, and you should get to the bottom of it".
(At Major Monogram) Am I right? Sir?
Major Monogram: (Indistinct mumbling)
Carl: I'm gonna take that as a yes.
Good luck, Agent P.

Linda: And this fossil is the only representation of the glichiolous species from the Jurassic era. How exciting.
Candace: (Growls) Why do I have to endure this suffering while Phineas and Ferb are off who knows where doing who knows--
(Gasps) What are you doing?
Phineas: Fixing a time machine.
Candace: (Gasps) You broke the exhibit?! I'm telling Mom!
(Electricity fizzing)
What are you doing? (Gasps) You broke the exhibit?! I'm telling Mom!
Phineas: Cool.
Isabella: Hey guys. Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: We're fixing this time machine.
Isabella: Isn't that kinda impossible?
Phineas: That's a possibility.
Isabella: Good luck.
My troop and I are going to the local fossils exhibit. Catch up with you later!
Phineas: Bye.

Heh. I have mice? I- I wouldn't go in there if I were you!
(Blinking)
Perry the Platypus, I swear, I've never seen this secret agent looking panda before.
(laughs) Well, there's a panda in my closet and a panda paw print on my cheek. But it's not what you think. We're not enemies, we're just bad friends.

Officer: Whoa, whoa, whoa, there, little missy.
There's no yelling. Didn't you see the sign?
Candace: Oh, that's right. It's a museum. I wouldn't want to WAKE anyone up!
Boy: You got tossed out too, huh?
Candace: Yeah, for yelling.
Boy: You yelled in the museum? That is hardcore.
Candace: Why'd you get thrown out?
Boy: Stole a pterodactyl. It's not like I yelled.
Candace: You gotta help me sneak back in! Please, please, please!
Boy: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
I've got a plan so ingenious it involves military-like stealth, precision and timing.

Candace: (Laughs) Part of the fossil exhibit, that's a good one!
(Laughs) Oops, gotta go. That was close.

Phineas: Okay, Ferb. We're ready to test the circuit quanta stabilizers. Testing.

Candace: Mom!

Candace: Hi, Jeremy.
Jeremy: Candace, you're really kind of freaking me out.

Officer: Say, aren't you a little young to be working in a museum?
Phineas: Yes. Yes I am.
Officer: Well, it's nice to see young people taking an interest in history.
Can I get you boys anything? Anything at all?
Phineas: Actually, there seems to be a piece missing. It looks sorta like this.
Have you seen it?
Officer: Hmm. Looks familiar. I'll keep my eye out for it.

(Chorus vocalizing)
Doofenshmirtz: Sorry, Perry the Platypus, I didn't want you to find out this way.
Okay, here it is. Peter the Panda is my new nemesis. We met at an evil genius expo in Seattle, and, well, me and Peter, we instantly disliked each other. And then, he foiled a little evil scheme of mine. And, I didn't plan it that way, it just happened.
(At Peter) Peter the Panda, be a dear and go get us a soda.
(At Perry) It's not that I don't hate you anymore. I do, but look, I-- I just think it's time for us to, you know, take a break and start fighting other people.
(At Peter) Thank you, Peter the Panda. (Sips)
(At Perry) I'd offer you one, Perry the Platypus, but I-- I think it's better if we just have a clean break. Don't you? So, where was I? Oh, yes.
(At Peter) So, Peter the Panda, you think you have outwitted me!
(At Perry) Perry the Platypus, you're—you're making this harder than it needs to be. Go on, it's over now.
Oh, that? That's a Freeze-Inator ray but, uh, I-- I don't want to explain it again. I just gave the whole spiel to Peter. But, don't worry. He's stopping me. He's-- He's got it well in hand. Goodbye.
(At Peter) Curse you, Peter the Panda!

Candace/Officer: (Screams)
Officer: You? I thought I tossed you out!
Hey, what's this? Stealing a part of a display is serious. Almost yelling serious.

Phineas: And last, but not curcuitly not least. Heh, heh.

Officer: Huh?
Candace: Mom!

Officer: Can I get you boys anything? Anything at all?

Candace: You guys better figure out a way to get us home. 'Cause if we don't get home, I can't bust you for this!
Phineas: Hey, that looks familiar. Guys, come here. Anyone recognize that bad boy?
Candace: Uh, that looks like a footprint from the beast that tried to eat me alive.
Phineas: And, it happens to be the very same footprint that's fossilized in the museum.
Candace: Great. But how does that help us get out of prehistoric times?

(Meanwhile, Perry catches up with Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus, but you are too late. .... (Perry attenpts to turn it off) Wait! Wait, don't touch that! .... Stop it! Stop it! (Perry tickles Doofenshmirtz) Stop it, I told you! Stop it! I said, keep your hands off of that.

(Cut to the cirque tent)
Buford: Hey, I got my costume all set. Be sure to introduce me as The Amazing Baggo.
Phineas: You know, we've been thinking about your act and have some suggestions. Modify your torque and reverse the angle of trajectory.
Buford: I still get to land in the mud, right?
Phineas: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Buford: I want the mud.
(audience cheering)
Phineas: Thank you, Django, the Human Pretzel!
Django: (moaning)
Phineas: That's gotta hurt. And now, our next act will catapult through the heavens, and land in a pit filled with the mysterious Aztec mud of doom!
Audience: Ooh! hoo!
(Candace runs in the tent)
Candace: Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! (gasps) He saved me a seat.
Phineas: I give you The Amazing Baggo!
Buford: Taa-daa! Hey!
Candace: Guys, cut it out. Let go!
Buford: That dude's stealing my act!
(Too late, Candace gets flung out of the tent)
Ferb: (whistles)
Phineas: Hmm. He must have been lighter than we calculated.
Buford: No, no! This is Buford's moment to shine! (jumps into the pit of mud) Hey, everybody, over here!
(all cheer)
Phineas: Wait. How'd he get down there?
Ferb: Perhaps Buford truly is amazing.

(Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz, making him crash into the on/off switch)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, great, now this thing's broken. (The tube of Doofelium lowers into the hole Candace made)
Phineas: And now, ladies and gentlemen, (voice-pitch rising) I give you our entire cast in our grand finale, featuring The Amazing Perry!
(They then give off an amazing finale complete with Perry landing on the moon prop; the tent blows up and skyrockets into Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: (Voice rising) Curse you, Perry the Platypus! the crash causes an explosion)
(Cut to the backyard)
Kids: Thanks, Phineas. You're the coolest.
Boy: That was the best circus I've ever been to.
(Ferb pulls a lever and removes the bleachers)
Linda: Hi, guys.
Phineas: Mom, Dad, you missed our cirque.
Linda: Well, it sure looks like you had fun. (Perry chatters) Who wants to hear my CD?
Phineas: Ooh, I do.
Lawrence: All right, come on!
Phineas: Cool.
(They go in the house; Candace crawls onscreen) Candace: (moans, back to normal voice) Oh, well, at least I'm back to normal.
Jeremy: Hey, Candace. My mom played me some of their CD. Your singing is awesome! How'd you get your voice to sound like that?
Candace: Oh, same as all the great blues singers: wild parsnips.

(Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Linda: What a beautiful summer day. Do you boys have anything exciting planned?
Phineas: We're either gonna make this nuclear-powered submarine or this incredible shrinking ray.
But for some reason, Ferb and I can't seem to make up our minds.
Linda: Well, I've made up my mind. (hugs them) You two have the most wonderful imaginations.
Candace: It's real, you know.
Linda: What's real, dear?
Candace: The submarine? The shrinking ray? They're really gonna build that stuff.
Phineas: (walks up) Well, actually we haven't (Candace pushes him away with her spoon) decided yet--
Candace: (talking fast) Anyway, when I try to bust them, everything will just magically disappear. Always happens. you'll see. Well, you won't see. I'll see, trust me.
Linda: (Oblivious) As usual, the imagination in this room is astounding! (walks away)
(Candace's cell phone rings)
Candace: (With the spoon in her mouth) Hello?
Jeremy: (On phone) Hi, Candace. (cut to him) It's Jeremy. I was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk today?
(Candace spits out her cereal then daintily wipes her mouth with a napkin)
Candace: I would very much enjoy going for a walk. Wherever shall we go?
Jeremy: To my uncle's restaurant?
Candace: Yes! That sounds do-able! Why not pick me up around noon? Okay! Goodbye. (hangs up, dials) Oh, my gosh! Guess who just called and asked me out on a date!
Stacy: (On phone) Who!?
Candace: Jeremy!

Phineas: Submarine, shrinking ray. I just can't make up my mind!
Isabella: (offscreen) What'cha doooin'?
Phineas: Oh. Hi, Isabella.
Isabella: (Walks up walking her dog) Hi, Phineas! You remember Pinky.
(Close up of Pinky)
Phineas: (offscreen) Oh, yeah! Hi, Pinky!
Isabella: (Showing her Fireside sash) Hey, check out my new sash! It's got all my accomplishment patches sewn onto it. (holds aforesaid sash in front of him) See?
Phineas: Wow. That looks totally irreplaceable.
(Pinky jumps up and swallows Isabella's sash.)
Isabella: Oh no! Pinky, I need that sash for a Fireside Girls ceremony this afternoon!
Phineas: Don't worry, Isabella, we'll get your sash back.
Isabella: But how? It's in Pinky's stomach.
(Ferb holds up the blueprints.)
Phineas: Hmm... (realizing) Ferb, you're a genius! Hey, where's Perry?

(Camera pans to Perry, who's hiding behind the fence. He puts on his fedora and then enters in a code on a panel. A fence post catapults him, an entrance opens, and he falls into it. After a quick "shot" of him sliding down in a tube, he's in his lair about a minute later.)
Major Monogram: Agent P, thanks for coming.
It's Dr. Doofenshmirtz. He's been hiding out in the old abandoned vacuum cleaner factory. You know, that building across town with the giant vacuum cleaner on top? Man, I can't believe that place closed. I blame the Internet. (pause)
Your mission, Agent P, is to find out what Doofenshmirtz is up to and then stop him.

(Scene shifts to the garage)
Isabella: So, how are we gonna retrieve my sash?
Phineas: Here. Ferb made this multimedia presentation. We shrink the sub down with Ferb and me in it and put in Pinky's dog food. After he eats us, the sub extrudes two mechanical arms, which fold up the sash to microscopic size and pull it into the sash storage unit. Finally, we pilot up into the mouth and have Pinky drool us out. Easy.
Isabella: Gross, but cool! But Pinky will eat anything but dog food. He likes grilled cheese sandwiches.
(Pinky pants excitedly)
Phineas: Not a problem. You make the sandwich. We'll make the sub.
(Ferb imitates Pinky's excited panting)

Man: Okay. A subatomic shrinking module, hydrostatic ballast tank, and a case of AA batteries. Sign here, please.
Phineas: Aren't you wondering if we're a little young to be building a submarine?
Man: Yes, yes I am.
Phineas: Yeah. We get that a lot.

Isabella: One grilled cheese sandwich, hot off the... Oh, cool!
Phineas: Hey, Isabella. You're just in time.
Isabella: You guys amaze me.
Phineas: When we're inside, we'll activate the shrinkage. You take care of the rest.
Isabella: Check it out, Pinky, your favorite.
(engine whirring)
Phineas: Ready?
(After a blue button is pushed, the submarine shrinks then lands into the grilled cheese sandwich.)
Isabella: It worked! All right, Pinky-Winky, time for some cheesy-weesy!

(A black cat yowls and Pinky's ears perks up. The cat hisses then runs off with a barking Pinky in pursuit.)
Isabella: (While running after Pinky) No, Pinky! Chasing the cat is so cliche! You're better than that!

Candace: (after opening the door to the garage) Listen up! Jeremy will be here any second and I wanna tell you...
(notices the grilled cheese sandwich)
Ooh, grilled cheese, my favorite. Might as well eat now, so I don't look like a pig on my date.

Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus? I... You know, we always do the same thing. I have a scheme, you try to stop me, I trap you, I tell you my scheme, you escape, then we fight, and I'm defeated. Let's mix it up a little. Let me tell you what. I will tell you my scheme first and then I will trap you! What do you say, huh? Yes, this is much better. Okay, so here it is.

Doofenshmirtz: Should I go with Make-Up-Your-Mind-inator? Or is that too-on-the-nose? It's funny. Now I can't make up my mind. Oof! (Perry attacks Doofenshmirtz in a frenzy and cuffs him to a wall) Perry the Platypus! What are... Well, I--I did not see that coming.

(Perry clamps the other handcuff onto a pipe)

Doofenshmirtz: Calling headquarters, huh? Hmm. Yes, you—you didn't even give me a chance to trap you.

(Camera pans to a giant snow globe, with the S'winter song)

Doofenshmirtz: See? I was going to put you in that giant snow globe over there. (Camera switches back to him) Now I have to return it.

Major Monogram: Agent P! What's wrong? Oh! You caught Doofenshmirtz, huh? That's weird. Usually he traps you, then you escape and then...

(Phineas's cell phone rings)

Phineas: Hello?

Isabella: Phineas, where are you? Pinky ran away, and when I came back, the sandwich was gone!

Phineas: Okay, let me call you back. (to Ferb) Yeah, we're inside Candace's stomach.

Ferb: That's creepy on so many levels.


(Scene shifts to the abandoned vacuum cleaner factory)

Doofenshmirtz: (Looking at his watch) This backup of yours is taking forever. (Points to the left while Perry gets up and stretches) I have a travel chess set in my bag over there. (Perry walks in the opposite direction) Do you play chess? (Still pointing to the left) Over there, actually.

(Perry opens the bag to the right, only get trapped by a magnet belt)

Doofenshmirtz: Ha ha ha ha! I tricked you, Perry the Platypus! (Takes a hairpin from his hair then uses it to pick the lock on the handcuff) Do you like my Any-Flat-Surface-Magnet-Belt? It sticks to any flat surface. Hee hee hee hee. Guess what? There's no travel chess set in this bag, either. (gets trapped by the other magnet belt) There was one of these in both bags, so whichever one you chose, you would be stuck. Just like I'm... stuck... right now. What, uh... wh-what time is that backup getting here again?


(Scene shifts to the mini submarine)

Phineas: Oh, here we are. Let's tap into Candace's nerve center so we can see what she sees. Ears. Eyes. Look, we're getting an image. She's on her date with Jeremy. That means we're on a date with Jeremy.

Ferb: Again, creepy on so many levels.

(Candace's cell phone rings)

Candace: Oh, excuse me. My phone is ringing. Hello?

Phineas: Candace, I know this sounds weird, but Ferb and I shrunk down in a submarine. We were in that sandwich you ate, and now we're in your stomach.

(Candace chuckles nervously)

Candace: Are you wacko? Don't call me!

Phineas: Wait! We can prove it! (to Ferb) How do we prove it? "(Ferb pulles up a feather duster to tickle Candace's insides)

Candace: Yeah. Why?

Phineas: Sorry, Candace. We have to help Isabella. So, arms and legs!

Phineas: Welcome to our beach.
Candace: Hah! You call that a beach? This is WAY below your usual standard. This isn't even worth a call to mom. You know, if you guys ever want to be popular, you're gonna have to stop playing in sandboxes. (Gets hit by a beach ball) Hey!

Doofenshmirtz: (narrating) Back in Gimmelshtump in the days of my youth, the Doofenshmirtzs' were a proud family. But those were lean times for my father and our beloved lawn gnome was repossessed. Who would protect our zatzenfruit garden from those witches, spells, and wood trolls? From a tender age, my father decided that it would be me.
Mr. Doofenshmirtz: Bewege dich nicht! ("Don't move!")
Doofenshmirtz: (narrating) While the other children played Kick-the-Schtumpel and eat Doonkelberries, I would stand for hours.
Mr. Doofenshmirtz: Bewege dich nicht!
Doofenshmirtz: (narrating) All through the cold night as the Spitzenhounds howled, my only companion was the moon. And my neighbor Kenny.
Mr. Doofenshmirtz: Bewege dich nicht!

Doofenshmirtz: And since my lawn gnome was taken away from me, I will destroy every lawn gnome in the entire Tri-State Area! Behold, the Destruct-inator! (He pulls a curtain, revealing the giant machine) And now, Perry the Platypus, to activate my creation! (pushes a button and opens Perry's trap) NOOOO! (Perry hits him)

Stanky Dog: First up in the surf contest is Bobby Nelson. Oh! And Nelson eats it on the five-footer! And there's Django Brown shooting the curl, and here comes Buford Van Stomm! Ohh! He pummels Brown with a Philadelphia traffic stomp! And now he's got him in a Half-Nelson, now a Full-Nelson, oh! And now he's actually beating him with Bobby Nelson! Here's the scores from our judges. (The scores show 1, 0, and 1/8.) And Buford doesn't like it one bit. (Buford throws Bobby at the table, smashing it.) Next up is Phineas Flynn, and it's great to see a young surfer show such confidence. Uh-oh, what's this? (Buford splashes through the holographic Phineas) Oh, those kids today and their holographic projections. He's in the pipeline, now he's hangin' ten! He's hanging twenty! He's hangin' thirty-two! Now he's just hangin'! The crowd loves it! I don't think there's a name for that! The crowd is doing the wave, and Phineas is surfing it!

Linda: (On phone) I'm right around the corner; I'll be there in two minutes.
Candace: Wait! No mom, you can't! (Linda turns off the phone.) Oh, wait, wait! Uhh... (at Jeremy) Stay right there! (runs off) I've got to stop her! (Looks out the backyard gate) Oh, no, no, no, no... (Linda arrives) Mom, Mom, pleeaaasee, Mom! Go away! Don't come in!

(Underground, the fight resumes. Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz into a lever, switching it to "Blow" forming a volcano in the middle of the ocean.)
Isabella: Is that a volcano?
(Volcano blows up, rapidly shooting out gnomes)
Stanky Dog: GNOOOOOMES!!! (Gnome hits him) Oof!
Man: Run for your lives!! It's gnome-ageddon!!!
(People run away screaming as gnome continue raining down)
Man #2: Who's protecting our gardens?!!

(Cut to Linda)
Linda: Candace, tell me the truth. What is going on here?
Candace: (Sighs, talking fast) Phineas and Ferb built a beach in the backyard, just like they said they were going to. But instead of just a cute little beach in a sandbox; it turned out to be this absolutely huge beach, with a coastline, and palm trees, and a pier, and hula dancers, and water skiers, and tiki huts, and dolphins, and dancing, and surfing, and everybody from the neighborhood showed up—

(As the fight continues underground, Perry hits the lever in Doof's face. As that happens, it switched from Blow to Suck.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oof! (The volcano starts sucking down all of the water, splashing down on Perry and Doof.)

Candace: ...and then I was just about to share a smoothie with Jeremy when a coconut dropped on my head, and (The water is still being sucked in the beach)...and just for a moment, it seemed that the wily Buford would steal away the coveted surfing trophy from under the noses of our heroes...(At the moment, the water was totally gone.) then I can only continue my benign reign and spread love, happiness and ultimate popularity throughout my kingdom! If you would just let me have my moment!
(The water was now completely sucked up. As people are looking down in the hole that was created, Perry climbs up into the surface.) Phineas: Oh, there you are Perry.
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: Well everybody, looks like that's all for today!
Crowd: Phineas and Ferb! (X3)

(The gate lifts and and closes)
Candace: If you don't believe me, go see for yourself.
(Linda enters the backyard)

Phineas: That was great.
Linda: Hey, boys.
Phineas: Hey, mom.
Linda: So how was your day at the beach?
Candace: Wait, wait, my kingdom...my Jeremy...it was all so beautiful...! (panics, at Phineas and Ferb) WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY PARADISE?! (pants)
Linda: Candace, honey, I think it's time to get you out of the sun for a little while. (she and Isabella lead Candace away.)
Phineas: I think she had fun.

Woman: (whispering) Are you Candace?
Candace: Yes.
Woman: (whispering) Get in. We're from the TV show. (cuts to inside the truck, normal voice) My name is Lulu Jones, and this is my assistant, Fifi.
Fifi: Hi there.
Candace: So you really think you can bust my brothers?
Lulu: Ha-ha-ha. You're so cute. Isn't she cute, Fifi?
Fifi: Oh, yes, she is. Ha-ha-ha!
Lulu: You see, Candace, busting is my middle name. It's my actual middle name. Lulu "Busting" Jones. I was born for this job.
Candace: But you have no idea what my brothers are capable of.
Lulu: Believe me, I know. That's why I created this show. My brothers used to drive me crazy. Let me tell you a story. (She shows her fists, one reading "bust", the other reading "them".) The story of "bust" and "them." (She pretends her fists are fighting.) "Bust" fights "them", but "them" fights right back. It's the age-old struggle, but in the end "them" always wins. No, I'm sorry. Wait, "bust" - ha-ha – "Bust" always wins. That's it. Yes, bust them. Ha-ha! The point is, I feel your pain. Mom never believed they were the ones breaking the plates or scratching the records.
Candace: Um, uh, my brothers don't break plates or scratch records.
Lulu: Well, whatever they're doing, we'll get them. Our crew has planted cameras covering every square inch of your backyard. Basically, if a squirrel breaks wind, we'll have it on tape. Fifi, none of these cameras seem to be working.
Fifi: Actually, I think camera number eight is working fine.
Squirrel: (breaks wind)
Candace: So, your show must be pretty popular, huh?
Lulu: Well, you know, not really. We're having some problems with our ratings right now. Our station manager is threatening to pull the plug, but with an episode like this one, it'll never happen! Come on, gimme one!
Candace: One what?
Lulu: A "Bust 'em!" Gimme a "Bust 'em." Come on!

(Being chased by a dinosaur; Roaring) Isn't there something I'm supposed to remember? (Flashbacks end) We should do something perfectly nice for Mom, what with Dad being out of town on business and all.
Candace: Okay, Candace, once from the top.

[In Linda's room.]
Mom, let me be the first to say--
Phineas: Happy birthday, Mom! We brought you some periodicals - like Mom Daily, Mom Weekly, Mom Bi-weekly, and just the way you like it, half-caff, double-frapp, mocha choco-latte mezzo-espresso.
Linda: Oh, wow. You boys really outdid yourselves.
Phineas: Au contraire, mon mere. I declare it's our mission to give you the best birthday ever. So relax, enjoy some reading, and no peeking till we come get you.
Linda: Oh, those boys are too much! Mmm. Oh, I smell eggs and bacon.
[Later in the kitchen...]
Phineas: Thank you, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro! We appreciate you helping us out. Ooh. Another call. (Beep) Talk to me. Buford, my man. Uh, hold on. [To Ferb] Needs roughage. [To Buford] Thanks, Buford. Glad we can count on you. (Candace clears throat) Hey, Candace. Wanna man the omelet station for Mom's birthday?
Candace: I'm doing my own thing. (Phineas and Ferb blinks) What? Are you going to tell them what it is?
Phineas: Sure. Uh, what are you doing?
Candace: It's a secret.
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?
(Cut to Agent P spinning his picture and going to his lair)
Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. 17 minutes ago, our spy satellites located Doofenshmirtz. He's hiding out in his mountaintop castle laboratory, where he's purchased some suspicious items over the internet, including a giant metal sphere and two animatronic wax robots, you know, like they have at theme parks. Gosh, those things give me the creeps, the way they're all robotic and waxy? (Shudders)

[Back in the house, in Candace's room]
Candace: The boys may have won breakfast, but wait'll Mom sees this homemade birthday card. "Love, the child who loves you most, Candace."
[Linda is blindfolded.]
Phineas: All right, Mom. Almost there.
Linda: Oh, this is so exciting.
Phineas: Okay, you can look.
All: Happy birthday!
Linda: (Gasps) What a beautiful breakfast.
Candace: Mom?
Phineas: Made with love.
Buford: And sweat.
Linda: And by "sweat", you mean hard work.
Buford: Uh, sure.
Candace: Mom, this may not be a fantastic breakfast, but—
Phineas: Ladies and gentlemen, Mom's birthday card!
(All gasps)
Candace: "To Mom"? Heh. It may be big, but bo-ring.
(Broadway music)
Linda: Oh, boys. I can't believe you two made it yourselves.
(Candace eats the birthday card)
[In the castle laboratory]
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, The Unicorn Whisperer, the feel-good movie of the year. And soon it will be gone. (Laughs maniacally; Perry appears) Oh, no! It's Perry the Platypus! Ha! I fooled you, Perry the Platypus! I'm not really scared! I'm not scared, because I have a new security system. Voila! (door opens to reveal two robots that look like Abraham Lincoln and George Washington) Ha ha! Do you like them, Perry the Platypus?
Wax Robots: Get him.
Doofenshmirtz: I got them very cheap from a wax museum that went bankrupt. Ha ha! Ha ha ha! I love it when dreams fail. As you know, I've been trying to take over the Tri-State area for quite some time now, and I realized this Tri-State area's filled with things I detest, so many things, like— (stops at a blinking traffic arrow) like blinking traffic arrows. Stop blinking at me, telling me where to go. Point. Point. Point. Ooh, I hate you. Let's see—what else? Ear hair. Oh, yes, I've always hated you. Pelicans. Terrible creatures. What—what are you, a bird or a garbage disposal? Ugh, musical instruments that start with "B". You get the idea. It's a long list. I've been working on it for a while. Anyway, I realized I should build something that would make all those awful things disappear. Behold, Perry the Platypus—Shrink-spheria! (Dramatic music) You like it? I was going to call it a Shrinkinator, but I've done that whole "inator" thing before. It's just been done to death. Bring him over here! I want to show him how it works. I enter the name of something I hate. P-e-l-i-c-a-n. Pelican. And Shrink-spheria homes in on its molecular structure and then turns all the particles into sparticles, thereby shrinking it into a teeny, tiny speck so small I never have to see it again. So good-bye to you, Perry the Platypus. Enjoy your presidential suite! (Laughs maniacally and closes the door)
[Back at the kitchen]
Phineas: Glad you like the card, Mom.
Ferb: It's a simple postmodern fusion of origami and pop-up.
Phineas: Yeah, and just wait till you see your present. Okay. Stay right there.
Linda: Oh, I hope the boys don't go overboard with my present. All I'd really like is that dress from that cute little sundress shop.
Candace: You mean that really cute one with the polka dots? (goes out on her bike) I know what she wants. Cute little sundress. Cute little sundress. Cute little sundress.
[Back at the castle]
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, Perry the Platypus, say goodbye to blinking detour signs! Forever! (Laughs maniacally)
Yes! I'm an evil genius! Ha ha ha ha! Now I have to wait 4 minutes for it to recharge, which isn't so bad.
I think I'll go with pelicans next. What do you think Perry the Platypus? Pelicans next?
(During this, Perry gets a dart, shoots it at the rope making the chandelier fall and melt the robots)
Wax George Washington Robot: I cannot tell a lie. I'm melting.

Candace: Hey, everybody! Look what— You got to be kidding me.
Phineas: Our first supermodel sports a chic, stylin', notcouture sundress perfect for our birthday queen to sip iced lattes while enjoying a fabulous day in the sun.
Candace: Hum. Well, they have the wrong sundress. It's okay, but it is not as great as this. (sees the moths on the dress) AAAAAH! (runs inside)
Linda: Candace? Candace? Where'd she go?
[Back in the castle, Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz making him hit the controls]
Doofenshmirtz: Ow! (he sees he pressed one of the buttons) Oh, well. Good-bye to musical instruments that starts with "B"!
[Back at the house, Candace has got away from the moths by running into her room.]
Candace: (Panting) Wait a minute! I can still give mom the one thing the boys can't! The gift of music! Played on my good friend: the bass. (Bass guitar disappears) Huh. Oh, well, it's a good thing I play the banjo! (Banjo disappears) It's a good thing I play the bassoon! (Bassoon disappears) It's a good thing I play the bugle!

Linda: Candace, honey, come join us. The boys have put together a little video.
Phineas: Yeah. Here, you can do the honors.
Candace: Fine, whatever. [starts video]

Wax Abraham Lincoln Robot: (Whirring) A house divided cannot stand.
Wax George Washington Robot: Yeah, what he said.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, Perry the Platypus, you melted their wax, but you can never melt what's inside—pure evil! (The two robots leap out, only to fall in the sphere making it explode] Ehh. I should have seen that coming.

Phineas: Are you kidding? This is a great painting! Your Dad would love this.
Django: But it's so small, and everything my Dad makes is so big.
Phineas: Why don't you just paint something bigger?
Django: But where will we find a canvas big enough?
Phineas: Look out there, Django. Your father's display just happens to be right next to the Unpainted Desert. And that gives me an idea. (to Ferb) Ferb, we're gonna need some really big art supplies.

They randomly jump on the paint tubes. Next, Ferb is jumping on the trigger of a giant aerosol spray can. Phineas thumbs up and the hose sprays blue paint, spraying the Unpainted Desert. Then a helicopter with a giant paint roller goes along the blue paint showing red paint. Django, Phineas and Ferb do this, as the camera switches scene with purple paint. A crane with a paintbrush moves with green paint, and Phineas pumps a heavy water balloon and gives it to Django. He puts it on and launches the catapult, and more water balloons are shown splatting different colors. Django surfs on a giant paintbrush with blue paint, then Phineas with yellow paint, then Ferb with green paint. 3 colors splat against the camera as the theme song ends)

Phineas: That's it! Ferb and I are gonna make you the scariest haunted house ever! (Organ) Zombies, werewolves, and ghosts, and vampires, and witches!
Candace: (Clears throat)
Phineas: Oh, hey, Candace.
Candace: Phineas! The only way you're building a haunted house in this backyard is over my dead body.
Phineas: (Deep voice) That's the idea. Muahahahah!
Candace: That's it, you little psycho! I'm calling Mom! (she slams the door; then opens it) And I am not using the banana this time! (she slams the door again)
Phineas: You guys heard that, right? It wasn't just me? 
(Inside)
Candace: Build a haunted house, my foot! (Phone dialing) They're so busted. Yes, hello. This is an emergency. I'd like to speak with Linda Flynn. To whom am I presently speaking?
Jeremy: Uh, Jeremy, that's whom.
Candace: J-J-Jeremy? (Stammers) Jeremy who?
Jeremy: Jeremy Johnson. My Mom's hosting a book club today, who is this?
Candace: We seem to be breaking up. I-I'm going into a tunnel... Sunspots, I-- ¡No habla español!
(Dial tone; Candace covers her mouth in embarrassment) 
(Cut to:)
♪ Doofenshmirtz's hideout-shaped island! ♪
(Perry drops from a plane and glides to the roof and climbs in. As he is looking around he is trapped by a crate)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus? HERE? How could this be? I'm shocked. (walks over to a map of the ocean with his hideout on it) I mean, it would have taken a total evil mastermind to have guessed that you'd track me to this point, find the secret hide-out, glide in under the radar and infiltrate through this access vent, make your way over to this crate, activating my automatic arm and leg restraints. Right here? This is the part where I get all sarcastic and pretend you surprise me. "OH, PERRY THE PLATYPUS?!? HOW? WHAT THE? WHO THE? WHY THE..." Oh! ...Finally ending here, where I finish showing you my brilliant plan. You see Perry the Platypus, this secret hideout doesn't actually belong to me. It belonged to my mentor, Professor Destructicon, Kevin, to his friends. Sadly, he was just captured in the midst of his latest plan to set fire to the sun! Redundant, perhaps. But before they locked him away, Kevin asked a favor of me: To prevent them from discovering his hidden lair and all its secrets, would I please SET FIRE TO THE SUN! I was like, dude, you really got to let that one go, it's a ball of fire! It makes no sense. So he asked me instead to simply destroy his hide-out, which I will now do, using my new Disintevaporator. (Clears throat; Dramatic music) And you, Perry the Platypus, will now be disintevaporated along with it! (Laughs maniacally) 
(Cut back to Candace)
Candace: Okay, just breathe and relax. (Sighs) Let's try this again. Hi. Uh, Linda Flynn, please. But if she's too busy, uh, then maybe there's someone else who can deliver her a message. Maybe someone in their teens!
Girl: Uh, who is this?
Candace: This is Candace. Candace Flynn. And who is this?
Suzy: I'm Suzy, Jeremy's little sister.
Candace: Well, it is such a pleasure to meet you on the--
Suzy: You called for Jeremy, didn't you?
Candace: Jeremy? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Suzy: You say you want your Mom, but you really want Jeremy. Isn't that right?
Candace: That's not true.
Suzy: I'm sorry, (Paper crinkling) We seem to be breaking up.
Candace: Stop crinkling paper! I know that trick!
Suzy: Bye bye.
Candace: Wait, wait, wait! It's true. I want to speak to Jeremy.
Suzy: I thought so. (At Jeremy) Jeremy, some girl's on the phone for you! (At Candace via phone) But never, ever forget, I am, and always will be Jeremy's favorite girl. Got it?
Candace: Mmm-hmm. Yes.
Jeremy: I got it, my favorite girl. (At Candace via phone) Jeremy here.
Candace: (Gasps) Jeremy!
Jeremy: Candace?
Candace: Uh, yeah, yeah, it's me. (Giggling)
Jeremy: Hey, you know, your mom's over here for the book club.
Candace: Oh, yeah. Well, I just have this silly question to ask her.
Jeremy: Well, they're breaking for coffee. (Jazz music) Wanna come over? We can hang out.
Candace: (Screams; which is heard by Phineas and Ferb)
Phineas: That was great, Ferb. But you should really save those screams for later, when the house is up and running.
Candace: Uh, I-- I mean, sure.
Jeremy: Cool. See you in about 20 minutes? (Hangs up)
Candace: (Faints) 
(Cut back to Destructicon's hideout)
Doofenshmirtz: Now I'll just load up a few things that Professor Destructicon let me store here. If there's one thing Kevin understood, it was closet space. Now, I'll just, uh, grab my keys to the escape jet, and, uh... Hmm. I could've sworn I put them in my lab coat. Oh, they're probably over here on the computer console...no. Ah, the kitchen. Hello? Keys? (Laughs) This is a little bit awkward, but have you seen my escape jet keys? (Perry nods) What? You have? Well, that's great! Where are they? (Perry turns his head away, refusing to tell him) You won't tell me? Is this because you don't speak, or are you just being a jerk? 
(Cut to Candace in a room with clothes spilled all over the floor; construction can be seen through the window.)
Candace: Oh, I can't believe it. I'm finally going to Jeremy's house. Okay, now, what would the perfect look be? (Gasps) I know: "Girl next door meets pop diva meets Hollywood bad girl crossed with an old school glamor goddess"! (Crash) Now I just gotta find the finishing touch. (She later goes outside dressed in a white t-shirt with a red flower on it, brown boots, a long green scarf, designer bootcut jeans with no back pockets, a white belt with a gold buckle and her bike helmet) Hey, boys! I'm off to the Johnson's book club. Jeremy invited me over.
Phineas: Uh, when you see Mom, could you tell her some snakes got lost in the house?
(Blade sharpener stops)
Candace: Okay! You boys have fun. See ya!
Phineas: Okay, troops. Thanks for coming on such short notice. Buford, I know this is cutting into your canasta game.
Buford: This better be good, pointy.
Phineas: Oh, it is. Isabella has been cursed... (Everyone gasps) ...with hiccups! (Everyone sighs) Worse case I've ever seen. We're building this haunted house to scare the hiccups out of her. To do so, we must dig deep into those terrible places any sane man shoves into the darkest, twisted corners of his mind. Each of you must find out what scares you the most. As you can see, today we're building a haunted house, electronically controlled by this giant organ. Every room is monitored on these screens. And by playing the keys... (Organ plays flinging Ferb into the roof of the house) ...I can trigger all sorts of surprises. So with your help, my friends, we can build this house with enough horror to destroy the involuntary contraction (Ferb comes out) of Isabella's diaphragm muscle once and for all! (applause) Oh, there you are, Ferb. (to crowd) Okay, people, let's get our scare on.

Why can't you accept your death with dignity and maturity and play "You're getting hot and cold" with me? Fine, be that way. I'll find my keys myself and teach you the meaning of grace under fire.

Candace: (Panting) What the-? (Suzy's poodle jumps off her helmet and runs off) What the-?
(Widen to reveal her seeing the haunted house from the backyard)
Candace: I don't believe this. 
(Cut back to Perry and Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: Let me get this straight. If I set you free, you'll give me the keys, right? (Perry nods) Oh, for Pete's sake, why didn't you say that, like, an hour ago? (Arm and leg restraints unlock) Oh, look, they were under your cute little platypus foot the whole time. (Laughs) Hurry, open, open, open. Now I grab my stuff. Hurry, hurry, hurry, must hurry. Seat belt, and ignition! (Engine whirring) Whew! That was close! (Laughs) Now, let's just make sure I didn't forget anything in my haste. Let's see, I've got my old basketball, the lamp, the Christmas lights, the umbrella, Perry the Platypus, the Disintevaporator, my golf -- PERRY THE PLATYPUS? (dramatic shock sound plays) THE DISINTEVAPORATOR?! (dramatic shock sound plays again) MY GOLF CLUBS?!? I don't even play golf! Oof! (He and Perry fight) How do you like it, huh? Agh! Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Time, time, time. I got a hair caught in my mouth. Blagh. (Grunting, Laughs, Alarm beeping) Since you saved me the trouble of opening the hatch, let me show you out! (Perry falls out and hangs on by the Christmas lights) 
(Scene shifts to the backyard, Candace has gotten a closer look at the haunted house)
Candace: Those two are in such big trouble! 
(In the haunted house)
Phineas: Okay, Ferb, raise the antenna. Let's see if we can up the scariness factor. You see, our haunted house is powered by static electricity. Maybe we can get a lightning strike to fire things up.
Candace: (Echoing) Um, hello? Phineas? Ferb? You two are in big trouble? (Door slams, Wind blowing) (Candace runs and tries to open the door but it’s locked) Okay, you guys, stop fooling around. You guys better come out now. I'm getting really mad. (Skeleton cracking)(Candace turns around) What was that? (She then turns back around and sees a monster and screams, she then runs off into the haunted house. the monster takes its head off to reveal Milly, Ginger and Gretchen)
(Giggling)
Milly/Ginger/Gretchen: Yeah!
(She then goes into a hallway where she is easily scared) Candace: (Screams) Stay away from me! (She goes into a room and pants)
Vampire: (Transylvanian accent) Good evening.(Candace turns on the light) It is evening, isn't it?
(Candace screams and run into some more spookables, including a Giant Floating Baby Head; The lightning rod picks up too much electricity)
Phineas: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Too much, Ferb! Too much! Watch out!
(Candace sees more spookables and runs throughout the house and runs into Buford and Baljeet; making them scream; Candace then runs through more of the house and ends up on the roller coaster and ends up in the top room)
Phineas: Candace?
Candace: Phineas! When Mom sees that you've built a haunted house in the backyard with werewolves and vampires and a Giant Floating Baby Head? What's that even about? (Baby coos) Not now! (Baby crying) And then there was a giant Jack-in-the-Box with a suit of armor that nearly took my head off, and you--you just drive me crazy! When I tell Mom what you've been doing, you are going down! Down, down, down! (walks off)
Phineas: Isn't there any chance that that cured your hiccups?
Isabella: (Hiccups)
(Candace enters the elevator, the Giant Floating Baby head is there as well)
Candace: Would you get out of here?! (The Giant Floating Baby head exits; cut to Perry swinging from the Christmas lights, they loop onto the top of the haunted house. As Candace walks out, the haunted house behind her is starting to be lifted, she barely notices. She suddenly sees Linda's car offscreen and smiles) Mom's home. Perfect! (runs to her) Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! Wait till you see what Phineas and Ferb have done! (The haunted house starts to lift off the ground, everyone leaves, except Phineas, who gets trapped)
Phineas: What's happening? Uh, guys? A little hellllllllllllp...!
Isabella: Phineas!
Phineas: (Falls, screams)
Isabella: Quick, everyone! Sashes!
(The Fireside Girls flip their sashes out like a trampoline)
Fireside Girls: Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!
(Phineas screams, bounces off the trampoline and lands in Isabella's arms)
Isabella: Now that...was scary. Hey, my hiccups are gone!
(Ferb gives a thumbs up; cut to Candace and Linda as the Fireside Girls walk out the gate.)
Candace: See? Absolute terror! These little creeps destroyed our backyard leaving this ugly mess in its place!
(Horror music; Close-up on Baljeet, who smiles and waves.)
Linda: Hi, Baljeet. (At Candace) That wasn't very nice, Candace. (walks inside leaving Candace stunned) 
(Shows Perry on the haunted house, which is being carried by Dr. D's rocket.)
Doofenshmirtz: Here you go, Perry the Platypus. Enjoy your disintevaporation!
(Dr. D throws the Disintevaporator on the the haunted house, and the force of the invention hitting the house is enough to break the string of Christmas lights, thus freeing the haunted house, which lands in the backyard. She turns around, notices it and smiles widely.)
Candace: (deeply) Ee-ee-ee-ee... (runs inside) It's back! Mom, it's back! (Horror music, zoom in on the timer on the Disintevaporator as it reaches zero. The machine destroys the haunted house, just before Candace drags Linda out.)
Candace: It's back! I told you! It's returned.
(Pause; Baljeet, holding his satchel, is in the middle of their empty yard again.)
Baljeet: Oh, excuse me, I forgot my satchel.
(Linda looks on in anger. Candace stares with a shocked expression on her face.)
Linda: (walks back inside, flatly) Goodbye, Candace... (Door slams)
Isabella: (Walks up) What's the matter?
Candace: Phineas and Ferb are the matter! This day was ruined, and I didn't even get to hang out with Jeremy!
Isabella: Sorry, but you know, it was the best day for me! Due to my incurable case of hiccups, I spent an entire day showered with undivided attention from Phineas! It was wonderful!
Candace: Hiccups?
(Isabella nods, Jeremy enters)
Jeremy: Hey, Candace. You ran away so quickly, we didn't get a chance to--
Candace: (Hiccups)
Jeremy: Sounds like you got a bad case of the hiccups.
Candace: (Hiccups)
Jeremy: Here, come on. Let's see what we can do about that. I got a glass of water with your name on it.
Candace: (Hisses)
Suzy: (To Buford) What? What did I do?
Buford: Heh, heh. Um, I- I'll, just uh, go.
(Ominous music) 
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb under the tree; Perry sits with them.)
Phineas: That was a great day, Ferb. What did you think the scariest thing was?
Ferb: Definitely the Giant Floating Baby Head.
Phineas: Yeah...
(The ending of the Phineas and Ferb Theme plays.)
Phineas: Yeah, where did that come from?! (Ferb shrugs) Hm.
(The theme continues.)

Pinhead Pierre: Time for the question of the day. Thank you, Debbie. And the question of the day is, "If you could have one superpower, what would it be?"

Major Monogram: Morning, Agent P. I apologize for using the emergency chute and, uh, for not telling you we had an emergency chute. But there was an emergency. Shoot! (Laughs) Sorry. (Clears throat) What I'm about to say is highly classified, Agent P. The last century, the forces of good and evil have been locked in a desperate race to harness and control the limitless power of dance.
Carl: Dance! How was that, sir?
Major Monogram: You came in a little late there, Carl. Get back over there. We'll try it again. (Clears throat) Blah, blah, blah, the power of dance.
Carl: Dance! Better?
Major Monogram: Early. Anyhoo, much to our horror, it appears the side of evil has won. Have you seen the latest issue of Evil Beat! magazine? Dr. Doofenshmirtz has created a ray that causes people to dance uncontrollably. It's up to you to stop him, Agent P. But be careful. It's a known fact that no one - no one - has ever defeated evil while dancing. Good luck, Agent P. 
(Back in the backyard)
Phineas: Excellent. We'll be up and running in no time. (Cow moos) Hey, sis.
Candace: Hold it right there, busters. (Truck beeping) Before I squeal on you rats, and you know I must, will you please tell me what's going on here?
Phineas: We're building an animation studio so we can make our very own cartoon show.
Candace: I thought cartoons were all made by computer.
Phineas: Yeah, that's right. This is just for the show. This is where the magic happens. It's the PF-5000 Animatron. All you do is tell the machine what you want. I'd like my cartoon character to have the power to be everywhere at once. I'll be called Multi-Man! And Ferb would have a utility belt and use lots of crazy gadgets. He'll be called, um, Ferb Guy.
Candace: Well, I would have super mind control and use telepathy and telekinesis to keep you super-dweebs under control with your lame-o superpowers.
Phineas: We could call you Control Freak. Come on, let's watch. (Music instrumental, whirring) We start with a few crude drawings. (Chickens clucking) We compile those into a storyboard, and it all gets fed into the computer. Then we add a little story and some pithy dialog. (Monkey screeches, Cat meows, Parrot noise) The Executron analyzes it and makes a few notes.
The Executron: Does not track. Whose story arc is this anyway? This one is not one of my favorites.
Phineas: The Artbot addresses the notes.
The Artbot: (Beeping, Glass smashing) No more notes. No more notes. (Crashes)
Phineas: A few changes are made, then it goes to timing. (Chanting) The shreds get fed into here, and somehow it all comes together here in the Animatic. Check it out. We're super dudes.
Candace: You guys are super busted as soon as I tell Mom.
Isabella: Hi, Phineas.
Buford: Whatcha do-- (Isabella elbows him) Ugh!
Isabella: Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Come into the Phineas and Ferb Studios, and we'll show you.
Buford: Hey, Isabella, about that "Whatcha doin'?" back there-
Isabella: Up, up, up! We'll talk about it later.
Phineas: Over here is where we add sound effects. Did you know that for years, a balloon was used for the majority of sounds you hear in cartoons? Ferb will demonstrate. Ferb?
Ferb: (Ding)
(Balloon squeaking, Poke, Flying noise, Running noise, Gun shoots, Cat meowing, Gaming sounds, Clang, Drill, Drum solo)
(Applause)
(Ferb blows on a balloon)
Baljeet: May we be in the show, too?
Phineas: Absolutely. A very wise and small-headed man once asked, "If you could have any superpower, what would it be?"
Isabella: I would harness the power of rainbows, unicorns, and sweetness to defend all that is good and just. I'd become... The Rainbow.
Phineas: Wow, that's great. What about you, Buford?
Buford: It's an interesting question you pose, as it reveals not only one's impulses and desires but one's deepest fears as well. I'll go with Belchman.

Baljeet: Oh! That's it! I will become Hanuman Man, a flying blue monkey that can grow as massive as he desires to crush all in his way!

I suppose you're wondering how I harnessed the power of dance. Well, to be honest, it was not so much on purpose. What happened was my dryer broke, so I was trying to create a ray that would instantly dry my clothes. But instead, well, look.

Still sopping wet, by the way. Turns out anything I hit with the ray starts dancing. For instance, a dryer repairman.

Phineas: Isn't the show great?
Candace: Are you joking? How could you make me the evil villain? Now everybody hates me!
Phineas: Au contraire, big sister. You're the star of the show.
Candace: I am?
Phineas: The crowd loves you.
Candace: But they're booing and hissing.
Phineas: Of course they're booing and hissing. You're the villain. Right, Ferb?
Ferb: A hero is a hero, but everybody loves a great villain.
(angry talking continues)
Candace: Really? Well, maybe I should go feel the love. (Puts head out of curtains, Tomatoes splatting) Love feels a lot like tomatoes. 
(Scene shifts to D.E.I.)
(Music continues)
(Doofenshmirtz kicks Perry, swinging by the ray, firing a laser hitting a mirror, causing it to dance) 
(Back in the backyard)
Control Freak: Oh, you'll never get away with this! You are SO busted!
(Crowd cheering)
Buford: (Laughs) We made a killing!
Phineas: But we weren't charging admission.
Buford: Ha-ha. Ha. Well, what are ya gonna do?
(Crowd cheering)
Phineas: Come on, everybody, let's take a bow.
(Cheering continues)
Candace: They like me! They really like me! (People yelling in anger again. Gets hit by a tomato) Feeling the love again. 
(Back at D.E.I.)
(Bouncy music)
Doofenshmirtz: You know, I'm getting pretty good at getting down. What do you think, huh? After all, everyone knows dancing is evil! Perry the Platypus, what are you doing? Stop with the conga line. We're doing the Macarena. Perry the Platypus, where are you going?
(-inator whirring; falls off the balcony)
I don't believe it! You defeated evil while dancing! Curse you, Perry the Platypus.
(-inator fires a ray; explodes) 
(At the Flynn-Fletcher home, the ray hits the studio, which causes it to start dancing.)
(Crowd gasps)
(Bouncy music)
Linda: Suddenly I feel like dancing. (Stops car)
(The studio and crowd congas out of the backyard, much to Candace's surprise.)
Well, I'm here. Now, where's this "giant, animation studio"?
Candace: It got up, and it danced away.
Linda: It...what?
Candace: It got up, and it, danced away.
Linda: (flatly) It got up and danced away?
Candace: See? It even sounds crazy when you say it. I'll be in my room. 
(Phineas, Ferb and Perry are sitting under the tree in the backyard listening to the radio.)
Radio Announcer: It's another gorgeous summer day here in the Tri-State Area. Ladies, have you asked a date to the Night of the Falling Stars Girls-Choice Dance yet? It seems Danville's gone star-crazy waiting for the meteor shower tonight!
Phineas: A meteor shower? How cool is that? Just think: somewhere out in space there's a bunch of asteroids headed right for Earth!
Lawrence: Hey, boys? Boys? Oh there you are! Hey, look what I got for you online!
Phineas: Oh, cool! You named a star after us!
Lawrence: You're now the owners of a little piece of the universe!
Phineas: Did you get one for Candace too?
Lawrence: Well, I did. Yes, of course I did, although she doesn't really care about this stuff. Anyway, they're practically giving 'em away online! D'you know, it's even better than the Oklahoma land rush of 1889!
Linda: Ah, those corny history references made me fall for him in the first place. Vivian and I are off to our mahjong tournament. Have fun today, boys.
Lawrence: Okay, darling. Good luck.
Phineas: Good luck!
Lawrence: Well, what am I doing standing here when I can be out buying more stars?
Phineas: Hey, Ferb. Now that we own a star, we should go check it out! And how cool is space travel? The g-forces, eating dinner out of a tube, going to the bathroom without going to the bathroom, not to mention the weightlessness. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. 
Candace: Uh, Jeremy, I was wondering, uh... if you'd like to go the Night of the Falling Stars Girls-Choice Dance with me.
Jeremy: With you? You've got to be kidding me. (He begins laughing)
(More and more people join in, until the entire world explodes)
Candace: (Talking on the phone) And that, Stacy, is why I can't ask Jeremy to the dance.
Stacy: You realize that's kind of a worse-case scenario, right?
Candace: That could very well happen. What if he says no? What if he laughs in my face?
Stacy: You can't let fear rule your life, Candace. Jeremy likes you. He's not gonna say no. Now, I'm gonna hang up, and when I do, I want you to call Jeremy. Don't man the phone, girl. Phone the man!
Candace: Yeah, I am not gonna let fear rule my life. (Dials number)
Stacy: (Muffled) Hello?
Candace: Stacy? Yeah, I can't do it.

Phineas: And this is Mission Control.
Isabella: Kinda small.
Phineas: Oh, it looks small on the outside. (They enter to reveal the inside is far bigger than it normally is.) But Ferb really knows how to maximize space.
Isabella: Hey Phineas, can I ask you something? Will you go to the dance-
Katie: (poking out of Mission Control) Excuse me Phineas, can I get you to sign some liability waivers?
Phineas: Sure thing. (To Isabella) Hold that thought, Isabella.
Isabella: Sure. No prob.
(Dramatic music plays as Phineas, Ferb, and Perry walk out in their spacesuits)
Isabella: Why are you guys walking so slow?
Phineas: Dramatic effect.
Isabella: You guys ready?
Phineas: (From inside the rocket) The star coordinates are pre-programmed. Let's light this candle.
Isabella: All systems go. Commence countdown.
Gretchen: (In a deep voice) Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, (A bird crashes into rocket) two, one. (She clears throat, then peaks in her normal voice) Ignition.
(Isabella presses the launch button, but the rocket engines sputter, and it fails to take off.)
Phineas: Looks like we need a Jump-start. 
Candace: Stacy, what if while I'm asking him, a satellite falls out of orbit and crashes into the— Wait a minute, what is going on out there? I'll call you back, Stacy. 
Phineas: Positive to positive, negative to ground, right?
Candace: (Climbing into Phineas and Ferb's spaceship) Brothers. Does every sister have to deal with this? No. Do I have to deal with this? Of course. You'd think I'd have better things to do and other things to worry about. Every single day, it's one thing after another. But do Mom and Dad see it? No. Do they get in trouble? No. And another thing– (She enters the cockpit, to find Phineas and Ferb aren't there)
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: Got the remote?
(Ferb pressed the button to start the car, and the rocket lifts off, taking the car with it)
Phineas: Oops.
(Candace screams)
Isabella: Uh, guys? I think you should see this.
(Candace continues screaming)
Phineas: Candace? How'd you get in there?
Candace: (Yelling) I can't hear you! My cheeks are covering my ears!
Phineas: We should probably help her. Good thing we built two rockets.
Isabella: Wow, it's pretty.
Phineas: It was for Candace to see her star. I don't know why she took ours.
(A satellite cuts through the wires connecting Candace's ship and the car)
Astronaut: (In a space shuttle, preparing to dock with the space station) Uh, ready to park this puppy?
(The car lands where the astronauts were intending to dock))
Astronaut: Oh, it's bad enough this happens on earth. Now space?! 
Phineas: We're coming to get you, Candace! Hey, she's coming in! (Speaking to candace over video phone) Candace, don't worry. It's pre-programmed. As long as you don't start hitting buttons randomly, everything will be okay.
Candace: I can't hear you! I'm too busy hitting buttons randomly!
(Phineas and Ferb glance at each other, exasperatedly)
Phineas: By the way, Candace, where's Perry?
Candace: I don't know. He must've gotten off before we launched.
Major Monogram: Agent P, afraid I have terrible news. It's Doofenshmirtz. He's built a space station, and due to budget cuts, we have no way of getting you into space. Now, I've contacted the president, and... Agent P, are you in space? Nice work. You are always one step ahead. Your mission is to find Doofenshmirtz and stop him, Agent P.
♪ Perry! ♪
Monogram: (Floating in space) Agent P? Agent P?
Candace: Uh, guys, what are all these red flashing things heading toward my rocket?
Phineas: Yeah, those are asteroids.
Candace: Asteroids? (She screams)
(Phineas flies their rocket through the asteroids)
Phineas: Just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We're catching up to her!
(Candace screams a few more times as two of her rockets are knocked off by steroids))
Phineas: Oop, she lost her engines. Let's go get her. 
(Perry gets sucked into a a spaceship designed as a robot torso)
Doofenshmirtz: I can't believe it's Perry the Platypus. (He traps Perry in an ice cube tray) Hohohohoho Perry the Platypus, what are you doing here? I thought you guys were having budget cuts. Well, it just shows to go ya. Hey, let's walk and talk. So, you're probably wondering why my space station has two enormous arms. Well, what you should be wondering is why it has two giant hands! Ha ha ha ha!
Doofenshmirtz: (Flashing back) See, during my teen years, I was very adept at hand shadows. It was great for entertaining at parties, and for meeting Fräuleins. But then one day, there was a new puppeteer in town. His name was Hans, and his hands were huge. We called him "Huge Hands Hans". His puppetry was garbage, but unfortunately, it was good enough for my Fräulein. I lost her to a boy with bigger fingers, and I never did a shadow puppet again.
Doofenshmirtz: Until tonight! (He laughs) And when the sun rises in one hour; see, right over there; Then everyone in the Tri-State Area will see my enormous hand shadows on the moon! 
Phineas: There she is! Uh-oh, this isn't good. Candace, you're in a decaying orbit.
Candace: What does that even mean?
Phineas: You just need to get to the spacesuit on the hook behind you.
Candace: Okay.
Phineas: Now put it on.
Candace: Okay, I'm putting it on.
Phineas: Now walk over to the door.
Candace: Okay, I'm at the door.
Phineas: Now just open it and take a little spacewalk to our ship.
Candace: What?
Phineas: Candace, there's nothing to be scared of.
Candace: Nothing to be scared of? There's the never-ending, icy-cold, soul-sucking darkness of space!
Phineas: (sing-song) I hear negative!
Candace: There is no way I'm going out there.
Phineas: We're just a few yards away. You can't let fear rule your life.
Candace: Of course I can. That's my thing.
Phineas: Candace, just calm down and take Ferb's hand.
Candace: Ferb's hand? (Ferb grabs her hand, and leaves Candace's ship, dragging Candace along, back to Phineas's ship) Thanks, guys.
Phineas: Mission Control? Come in, Mission Control.
Isabella: Phineas, did you find Candace?
Phineas: Yes. We've got her, and we're on our way home.
Isabella: Excellent. So, Phineas, speaking of home, there's that dance tonight, and– (An alarm begins beeping)
Phineas: Hold that thought, Isabella. I think we're out of fuel.
Candace: What? Find some fuel somewhere and let's go.
Phineas: That's gonna be hard. We're kinda nowhere.
Candace: You mean we're stuck here in the empty void of space?
(The spaceship approaches a large light source)
Candace: Phineas... what is that?
Phineas: I have no idea.
Astronaut: Uh, will the owner of a red station wagon please move your vehicle? You are in a shuttle loading and unloading zone only. 
(Phineas, Ferb and Candace's ship continues moving toward the light source)
Candace: What is that?
Phineas: I have no idea. (reading the signs that was emitting the light) Milk shakes? Wow, that was so bright, I thought it was a star. Maybe we'll find some fuel here. (The rocket lands) Are you sure you don't wanna come with us? Ferb says the oxygen levels are just like Earth.
Candace: Uh... I'm sure. Just find some fuel, and let's get out of here! (In the Bar)
Bartender: One sarsaparilla coming up.
Alien: I love you, man.
(The other alien punches the first with it's tongue)
Phineas: Hi. I'm Phineas, and this is Ferb. (The music in the bar stops playing)
Bartender: Wait a second. You're Phineas and Ferb?
Phineas: Yeah.
Bartender: Hey, everyone, it's the new owners!
(The aliens cheer)
Phineas: New owners? Those coordinates are right here. Ferb, this is our star. Wow. That sign really is bright.
Alien 2: I told you they'd show up.
Bartender: So now that you own the joint, what do you think of it? I know, it's a little run-down.
Phineas: I have a few ideas for this place. 
(Boys laugh)
(The Earth blows up)
Isabella: You do realize that's a worst-case scenario, right, Candace? But I do feel for ya. I've been trying to ask Phineas to that same dance all–
Candace: Phineas. What's taking those boys so long? They were supposed to find fuel ages ago. Later, Isabella.
Isabella: Sure. No prob. 
Doorman: (In a Cockney accent) Stop right there.
Candace: Let me in, buster.
Doorman: Phineas and Ferb don't take kindly to gatecrashers.
Candace: I'm no gatecrasher; I'm their sister!
Doorman: Ooh, sorry about that. Honest mistake. You won't mention this to them, eh?
Alien 3: Uh, I'm their sister.

Phineas: Ferb and I thought we'd fix up the place. You know, pride of ownership? Take a load off. Have a shake.
Alien 4: I can't do it.
Candace: Uh, are you okay?
Alien 4: No. The bicentennial Taming of the Yarks Dance is tonight, and I wanna ask the girl of my dreams, but what if she says no? What if she laughs in my face? What if her friends laugh at me? What if her friends' friends laugh at me?
Candace: Aren't you being a little overly dramatic? I mean, really, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Alien 4: Uh... the entire planet could blow up?
Candace: Please. I think you should just ask her to the dance.
Alien 4: Really? You think so?
Candace: I do. Really.
Alien 4: Well... Okay. (He takes a breath) Here goes nothin'. Ahem. Sylvia... will you go to the dance with me?
Sylvia: (Appearing, attached to his head) Well, of course. I've been waiting for you to ask me. I mean, even if you asked someone else, I'd still have to go with you.
Candace: See? That wasn't so hard.
Phineas: So... Candace?
Candace: Oh, I get it. Big lesson. Yeah, well, I learned that it wouldn't be hard to ask Jeremy out if he was growing out of the back of my head. Now you find us some fuel, and let's get outta here.
Phineas: Wow. I just wanted to know if she liked the shake. (to the bartender) You don't know where we could find some rocket fuel, do ya?
Bartender: Rocket fuel? It's all Ronaldo drinks.
Ronaldo: (In an Italian accent) Only imported rocket fuel.
(Outside Ferb fills Ronaldo's cup with fuel, then finishes fueling the ship)
Ronaldo: Grazie.
Candace: Let's go!
Phineas: Hey, Ferb, I'm sensing Candace wants to leave.
(Ferb spins the nuzzle back into its resting place)
Candace: Will you cut that out? 
Astronaut: Okay, that's it. I'm not waiting anymore. (The two astronauts lift the car away) Great. Let's park the shuttle. (A flying saucer lands) Oh, come on! (He throws his helmet off in fury, and quickly puffs up because of it) Uh-oh. I think I should go inside now. 
Candace: Why are we stopping?
Phineas: I don't get it. We have plenty of fuel. The battery's worn down. Candace, were you using the videophone without the engine running?
Candace: Yeah. Was that a bad thing?
Phineas: If by "bad", you mean we're stranded in the never-ending, icy-cold, soul-sucking darkness of space... then, yeah. 
Doofenshmirtz: Soon, Perry the Platypus, the sun will be at full strength, and my plan will come to fruition. Unless, of course, it's overcast... (An alarm begins beeping) Eh, but what are you going to do? Proximity alert? Why are there so many people in space? What's up with that? 
Isabella: You need another jump-start? Candace, didn't you have the engine running when we were talking on the videophone?
Candace: Am I the only person who doesn't know this?
Phineas: So, any suggestions, Isabella?
Isabella: Sensors are indicating a massive power source in your area.
Phineas: Where? I don't see it. (Doofenshmirtz's ship rises behind Phineas, Ferb, and Candace's) Wait a minute. I see it. It's Mom's car! We're saved! Ferb, toss me the starter remote. (Ferb shrugs) Ooh, that's right. We left it at home.
Candace: What's a starter remote?
Phineas: Well, legally we're too young to start a car. We get away with it by using a starter remote. But you, Candace, have your learner's permit. Looks like you'll be doing the jump-starting.
Candace: What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Can't you guys just find some old nuts and bolts lying around and jerry-rig up some kind of machiney-deely-bob and get us out of this situation?
Ferb: Candace, we are just kids.
Candace: ( She groans) Why am I arguing this? Hand me the suit.
(Candace get's into the suit)
Phineas: Let me turn on the oxygen.
(Oxygen flows into Candace's suit, inflating her rear-end)
Candace: Does this suit make my butt look big?
Phineas: Yes. Yes, it does. Maybe I had the pressure up too high.
Candace: Never mind. I'll fix it. (She backs up, and transfers the inflation to her hands) Well, I guess this is preferable.
Phineas: You can do this, Candace.
Candace: I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. 
Doofenshmirtz: (Watching) What is this? Now, why would an astronaut wear such big gloves? Wait a second! (He gasps) Huge Hands Hans?! It's Huge Hands Hans! He found me out in space! Oh, you're not going to steal a job from me this time, Huge Hands Hans! Nor my Fräuleins! 
Candace: How did it go again, Phineas?
Phineas: It's positive to positive.
Candace: Positive to positive.
Phineas: Negative to ground.
Candace: What ground? We're in space!
Phineas: No, no. Ground just means any piece of metal.
Candace: Any piece of metal? Well, then why do they call it ground? Why don't they just call it me- (She turns around and sees Doofenshimrtz's spaceship reaching to grab her)
Phineas: What's wrong, Candace? Candace? Candace, what's wro- (Phineas sees the ship as well) Oh. Danville, we have a problem.
Isabella: Okay, girls, turn to the giant robot section of your Fireside Girls manuals.
Phineas: Isabella, anything?
Isabella: Still looking.
(Candace screams as the robot grabs her)
Phineas: Isabella!
Isabella: Here it is. Okay. According to this, you should get the heck out of there!
Phineas: Great, but we've got no power. She didn't connect the— Candace, negative to ground!
Candace: What?
Phineas: Negative to ground, Candace! Negative to ground!
Candace: Oh, you mean negative to metal! (She attaches the jump lead to the robot, thereby giving the rocket a jumpstart) I did it! I did it!
Phineas: She did it!
(The rocket powers up and flies off, with Candace and the car in tow) 
Doofenshmirtz: No! Huge Hands Hans is getting away! Not this time, freak fingers! (Doofenshmirtz chases after them) Just you wait, Huge Hands Hans! You can run, but you can't hide! You know, he can run, but he can't– (Perry's ice tray smacks Doofenshmirtz across the face) Ow! Wait a second. How did you--? Oh, I see. That's it— (Perry, with the remote control launches back at Doofenshmirtz, making his togune stuck to the ice) That's not fair!..(Doofenshmirtz lets go and tice shatters, knocking him out and letting Perry free) Oh, that's it, It's on now! (As Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight, the arms of the robot swing, matching Doofenshmirtz's movements) 
Phineas: Isabella, I hate to bother you again.
Isabella: Oh, no bother.
Phineas: You got anything else? The robot's gaining on us.
Isabella: It says they don't corner well.
Phineas: They don't corner well? Wait a sec. Candace, fasten your seat belt. We're taking a little detour. (They steer the spaceship into the asteroid belt, swing Candace around) Now, how is she passing us?
Candace: Phineas, what are you doing?! (She screams)
Phineas: See? Corners like a dream. 
(Doofenshmirtz's ship gets hit by some of the meteorites, punching through the wall of the ship. Perry escapes out of a hole, as a large asteroid moves to strike the ship)
Doofenshmirtz: That's it! Run away, Perry the Scaredy– Oof. (With his face puffed up from exposure to the vacuum of space) Oh, I think I need to put on my spacesuit. Uh oh. (The asteroid strike Doofenshmirtz's ship) 
Lawrence: And now, my good man, you ready for this? Your tip. Your very own star.
Delivery Guy: Uptown, they give quasars. (He drives off) 
(Phineas and Ferb's rocket lands safely, and deposits the car in the driveway)
Candace: Oh, sweet land!
Isabella: Hey, Phineas, you guys were great.
Phineas: Thanks. You weren't too bad yourself.
Isabella: Oh. (She giggles) Thanks. So, would you like to go to the Night of the Falling Stars Girls' Choice Dance tonight?
Phineas: Sounds like fun.
Isabella: Really?
Phineas: Ferb, what's our schedule like?
(Ferb gives a thumbs-up)
Phineas: Okay, we'll be there.
Isabella: Both of you?
Phineas: Yeah. Why don't you come by, and we'll all walk over together?
Isabella: Sure. No prob. 
Linda: Thanks for the lift, Viv.
Candace: (Stares at her rocket ship and walks up to Linda) Mom!
Linda: Hey, sweetheart. Oh, look at your outfit. Hey, guess what? We won! (flatly) But the grand prize was a star.
Lawrence: (eating pizza) Ooh, whoo!
(Long pause)
Candace: (smiles) Mom, that's great, but you gotta see something in the yard. Come on, you gotta see it! Come on, come on!
Linda: All right, I'm a-comin'.
(Candace runs to the yard, but Linda stops and sees her car in the driveway.)
Linda: Hmm. (to Candace) Uh, I'll be right with you after I pull my car into the garage.
Candace: Yes, it's still here! (to Linda) See, Mom? There! Mom?
Linda: I'm just backing the car in! I'll be right with you!
(Just as Linda backs up, the cord still connected to the inside of the hood comes loose and starts the rocket up. It blasts off into space and takes Mission Control with it.)
Linda: So what did you want to show me, Candace?
Candace: (facepalms) Just go make some pie...
Linda: Or... (leaving) How about a healthy fruit salad? 
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, curse this tin can! Ugh, I'm going to need a jump-start! (Phineas and Ferb;s rocket crashes into Doofenshmirtz's, causing it to begin to fall towards earth) I, uh, no, I guess it won't help now. 
Phineas: Hey, Candace?
Candace: What?
Phineas: Ferb and I just wanted to say thank you. We were in a pretty precarious situation up there. If it wasn't for your bravery, who knows what would have happened?
Candace: Really? You think I'm... brave?
Phineas: Are you kidding? Ferb was goin' on and on about it.
Candace: Yeah, I was brave! (She gasps) I was brave! I'm not gonna let fear rule my life anymore! Now I've gotta go. I've got a mission to accomplish.
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: Hey, Perry. Where ya been? 
(At Jeremy's house, a knocking is heard)
(Jeremy gasps in shock)
Candace: Jeremy, will you go to the dance with me?
Jeremy: Candace?
Candace: (Reveals she's in her spacesuit) Yeah.
Jeremy: I've been waiting for you to ask me.
Candace: Really?
Jeremy: Yeah. Only, uh, uh, Candace, is that what you're gonna wear?
Candace: Why? You like it? 
(Scene opens with Phineas digging in a toolbox.)
Phineas: Hey, Ferb.
(Scene pans out to reveal they're on a very tall tower tinkering with Linda's car)
Phineas: Have you seen bolt #473? 
(Cut to Candace looking through the window)
Candace: Okay, it's still here. Oh, come on, Mom! We're really coming down to the wire on this one.
(Door closes) Mom! (She runs away then runs back) Oh, great and magical being who maketh all things magically vanish before Mom sees them. Knock it off!! 
Linda: Thanks, Vivian. See you Tuesday for totem pole carving.
Candace: Mom! Mom! Quick, Mom, look! Before it disappears!
Linda: Well, if it isn't the welcoming committee. -
(Candace starts shoving her into the yard)
Candace: No time for dry, witty remarks! Must move. Move, move, move, move! Move, move, move, move!
Linda: Don't you get tired of this?
(Candace stops shoving her)
Candace: What do you mean?
Linda: The same old routine every day. Doesn't it ever get--" mm, I don't know-- boring?
Candace: ...You know what? You're right. I guess it has gotten a little old. I just get so frustrated. I always come so close to busting Phineas and Ferb, but it ends the same way every single time. I look and say there's a massive "thing" Phineas and Ferb built right in front of me, but every time you look, you always say...
(While saying this, Linda turns and sees the parking tower, becoming shocked)
Linda: I...see it.
Candace: There it is. "I see it." Right on cue. Wait, what? Come again?
Linda: I see it!
Candace: You mean you see my point?
Linda: No, Candace. I see that! (she points at the tower)
(Tower beeps)
Candace: (Gasps) You do?!
Linda: How could I miss it? But I don't understand. How the...? Or who the...? B-- What the? (Something flies by them very fast and shaky)
Phineas: Hi, Mom! Check it out! The Flying Car of the Future; Today!
(The flying car parks at the top of the tower)
Linda: Is that my...car?!
Candace: (Ecstatic) She sees the car, too!
(Zoom in on Linda, her shock transitions to anger) 
(Cut back to Phineas and Ferb on the tower)
Phineas: (To Ferb) The Flying Car of the Future; Today, is still pulling a bit to the right.
Linda: (In the distance) PHINEAS! FERB! GET DOWN HERE THIS INSTANT!!! 
(They go down the elevator)
Phineas: Okay, Mom, be right down. 
(Cut to Candace and Linda, Phineas and Ferb walk by and notices Perry)
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry. (To Linda) So, what do you think, Mom? Pretty cool, huh?
Linda: Cool?! This is the most dangerous thing I've ever seen!!
Phineas: Don't worry, we were safe. Ferb invented a new invisible helmet head system. (He and Ferb take off hats that look like their normal heads) "When life's never dull, wear a hull for your skull."
Linda: How dare you do all this without permission!
Phineas: But all our building permits are in order.
Linda: I mean, my permission.
Phineas: This morning I asked you if we could modify our car to make it fly.
Linda: I was talking about your toy car!! How could you possibly think I meant my station wagon?! You are in SO much trouble, young man!!!
Phineas: But...we do this sort of thing every day.
Linda: (Her anger now replaced with shock) What?!!
Candace: (Sounding a bit smug) See, Mom? I told you...but you never listened.
Linda: But I...
(Linda begins to recall everything Candace has told her)
Memory-Candaces: Mom, Phineas and Ferb built a rollercoaster! Phineas and Ferb are one-hit wonders? Phineas and Ferb carved my face into Mount Rushmore. Phineas and Ferb are driving cattle. Phineas and Ferb built a giant tree house robot... (The next several begin to slur together as they quickly come to her) are promoting a boxing match...built a beach in the backyard...built a time machine... built a ski resort! Are directing a movie... built a haunted house... built a giant sundae maker... are getting the band back together... Phineas and Ferb are in my large intestine!
Linda: Oh, Candace. All the times I called you delusional and mocked you to my friends behind your back, all those journals I've filled with an eye towards stand-up comedy...but you were telling the truth! I'm so sorry. You're the best daughter any mother could dream of having.
Candace: Finally, you realize that! 
Lawrence: Well, what's all this yelling about? (Notices the tower) Oh, my word! That is impressive.
Linda: Did you know about this?
Lawrence: Well, I -- I...I -- I, uh...no.
Candace: (Clearly overjoyed) What are you gonna do to them? No TV for a month? Or -- they have to serve me for a year. (gasps) How about confiscating their toolbox? (gasps) I know! Take away their seats on the city council!
Linda: You have seats on the city council?
Phineas: We rotate out with the Board of Selectmen.
Lawrence: Well, some punishment may be in order, but, look, there's no harm done really.
Phineas: Hey, look, Ferb, here's bolt number 473. I hope that wasn't important.
(The tower suddenly falls over, demolishing a big part of their house. Everyone stares on, while the car lands safely on the ground, completely unharmed)
Phineas: Well, at least the self-parking works.
(Cut to Candace, Linda and Lawrence, the latter two looking on in anger)
Candace: (Grinning widely) Ee-ee-ee-ee!
(Phineas and Ferb stare at each other, wondering what happens next) 
(Scene changes to a picture of a bus full of "state prison" inmates, with Phineas and Ferb in a window. It's marked "Tri-State Penitentiary". The bus moves away, showing Phineas and Ferb in the bus for Smile Away Reformatory School. Inside the bus has students frowning.)
Linda: I'm sorry, but this is really for your own good. We need you both to understand that what you've been doing is way too dangerous. I'd never be able to live with myself if you got hurt.
Phineas: We were wearing helmets. (A sergeant walks behind the bus then holds a Smile Away Reformatory School brochure with an image of a sun on it.)
Sergeant: Don't worry. Your boys will be in good hands. As you can see from our realistically illustrated brochure, the Smile Away Reformatory offers a serene, peaceful environment in which safety, discipline and responsibility are encouraged. Your boys will be whipped into shape in no time.
Phineas: Well, I'll be honest, Ferb, I didn't see this coming. (Notices Baljeet is on the bus too) Baljeet? What are you doing here?
Baljeet: Well, I got kicked out of summer school because my grades were too high. But then I heard about this place! Sure, they break you down and strip you of your identity, but school is school.
Lawrence: Bye, boys. See you at the end of summer!
(The bus drives away)
Candace: Yes, I actually busted Phineas and Ferb! (gasps happily) This is the happiest moment of my life! Woo-hoo! (She acts like an acrobat.) I'm finally free! (Elsewhere in the sky, she hang glides with Stacy and Jeremy, soaring pass a meadow.) 
(Candace and the two teenagers ride on a horse which jumps over a fence. Stacy and Jeremy are on a speedboat as Candace is on a water ski. Candace launches herself through a ramp, passing double-decker buses and playing in an arcade. The puck goes through Stacy's goalie. Candace wins, as Jeremy holds up a bouquet of flowers. It's marked, "Winner". Flowers fall down the screen as we see Candace and her friends riding a horse. Candace and Jeremy dance flamenco in a stage. Behind them is a banner marked, "Tri-State Dance Contest". The dancers twirl as roses fall on the stage while an offscreen crowd is cheering. A trophy shines behind a window as Candace is wiping it. An imaginary image of Phineas and Ferb appears and disappear quickly.)

Phineas: That doesn't look like the brochure. 
(Inside, Sergeant is shaving all the kids' heads. As he gets to Baljeet, he is stopped)
Baljeet: (Squealing) I was too excited to wait. (Takes off his wig) I shaved last night. Just call me Bald-jeet. Heh-heh. Get it? "Bald-jeet"? 
Sergeant: Okay, listen up, maggots! You are here because your parents (Mockingly) are worried about you. Now, the way I see it, the root of all children's problems is unacceptable levels of imagination, fun, creativity and unbridled enthusiasm! Don't you eyeball me! Our goal at this school is to crush the dangerous elements inside you and replace them with structure, order, discipline and conformity.
(Drilling is heard nearby)
Sergeant: What--? (he looks over to see Phineas and Ferb doing something to their bunk bed) Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Oh, a few simple modifications. We call it the "Ferris bed." It makes trading off (♪ carousel music) fair, simple and fun. As well as giving easy access to the top bunk. All at the push of a button. Pretty cool, huh? 
(Inside a bathroom, Phineas and Ferb are cleaning with toothbrushes while the Sergeant watches them)
Phineas: You know, this is a very inefficient way to clean a bathroom.
Sergeant: That's the idea! Now, make it shine!
♪ Funky jazz
Sergeant: And no funky rhythms! (Leaves)
Phineas: I thought it had more of a free-form jazz vibe. Huh. Well, you can't please everybody. 
(Back at the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Candace: Oh! Ow-ow!
Stacy: What did you do?
Candace: I tripped over Ferb's old toolbox.
Stacy: Well, do you wanna go horseback riding?
Candace: What's your hurry? Let's relax for a little while. You know, with Phineas and Ferb gone, I've had a blast doing things I wanted to do. But it's strange. I kind of miss the little guys. It's as if there was a whole other side to our relationship that I never noticed before.

Candace: Ok. Maybe a little TV will take my mind off things. (turns on the TV)
Morty Williams: Today on "The Morty Williams Show," "My Kid Is Bad, and I Want to Blame Others!" We'll go inside the nation's toughest reformatory school, where free-thinking children undergo complete personality re-programming and have all the creativity and imagination sucked right out of them. They are forced to think inside the box.
Candace: Wait a second. They don't belong in a place like that. I know what I have to do.
Jeremy: Hey, Candace.
Candace: Jeremy? How did you get in here?
Jeremy: There's a huge gaping hole in the side of your house.
Candace: Oh, yeah, well, Phineas and Ferb would've usually fixed that by now.
Jeremy: You wanna go horseback riding?
Candace: Would you stop already with the horses? Jeremy! I know what I'm gonna do today! I'm gonna bust my brothers...
Jeremy: Didn't you already do that?
Candace: Out! Bust my brothers out!
Jeremy: Cool. I always liked your brothers. I'm coming with you.
Candace: (gasps) You mean, like a date?
Jeremy: Yeah. A weird sort of prison-break kind of date. 
(Back at Smile-Away Reformatory School, Phineas, Ferb, and Baljeet are being forced to watch a video, with machines holding them in place) 
Recorded female voice: Age-inappropriate building is unsafe and irresponsible. Good boys don't make anything but their sisters happy. Creative acts are imitable and dangerous. Using your imagination is morally wrong.
Baljeet: The book was so much better. 
Linda: Hmm. It's a letter from the board of selectmen. The city council is proposing a millage to cover the overage from last quarter, and they need Phineas and Ferb's input.
Lawrence: (sighs) Perhaps we were a bit hard on them.
Linda: Yeah, they really did believe they had permission. I suppose it was all a big misunderstanding.
Lawrence: Well, let's go get 'em, shall we? We can take the Flying Car of the Future...Today.
Linda: Weren't you supposed to get that changed back to normal?
Lawrence: Yes, yes, but you must admit, it's pretty cool!
Linda: Yeah, it's pretty cool. 
Lawrence: Hey, where's the Flying Car of the Future...Today? 
(Changes to scene where Candace and Jeremy are in The Flying Car of the Future...Today, almost crashing into a tree)
Candace: Agh! Sorry. The Flying Car of the Future...Today is pulling a bit to the right.
Jeremy: Are you kidding? This is the best date ever.
Candace: (screaming laugh) Whoa-oa-oa!

Candace: No, I'm trudging. I never knew people actually trudged.
Jeremy: Look, we're here.
(Candace knocks on the door. Sergeant then opens a window to show only his eyes)
Sergeant: What do you want?
Candace: Um...uh, hi. Yeah, I'm here to see my brothers, Phineas and Ferb.
Sergeant: They don't graduate till the end of the summer. Get lost. (shuts the window) 
Candace: So much for the direct approach. It's time we tried it Phineas and Ferb style. 
Jeremy: Is this gonna work?
Candace: It's just like the Trojan horse from history class. They'll accept this as a gift, then after everyone falls asleep, we'll jump out and rescue Phineas and Ferb. 
Sergeant: You two again? I thought I told you to get lost!
Candace: Maybe we gotta think bigger. 
Sergeant: Wow, what a thoughtful gift. Too bad I don't have room for you, handsome. I'm gonna have to get a bigger yard. 
Candace: (whispers) Now's our chance.
Jeremy: Yes, we did i-- 
Candace: Oh, what is this, hair? Gross! I bet you regret coming along with me now, huh?
Jeremy: Actually, I'm kinda havin' fun. You know, crazy, prison-break kinda fun.
Candace: And, ew! Look at this. "Baljeet's summer wig. Store at room temperature"? (notices a nearby billboard) Huh? The Morty Williams Show? Wait a second. I've got a plan. It's foolproof. 
Candace: (deep voice) Yes. Clearly I'm Morty Williams, and I'm back to do another segment.
Sergeant: Hey, aren't you a little...female to be Morty Williams?
Candace: Uh, well, you know what they say. The camera adds...masculinity.
Sergeant: Great. Well, come on in, Morty.
Candace: We're doing a follow-up show on Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher.
Sergeant: My biggest success stories. Right this way. Ah, Phineas and Ferb. Such curious and self-reliant children. So fun-loving, imaginative and creative. Fortunately, we got to them just in time. See for yourself. (to Phineas and Ferb) Flynn, Fletcher, fall in! (Phineas and Ferb come out of lockers, to Candace) You see, here at the Smile Away Reformatory, our motto is, "It's structure, order and discipline today, so tomorrow it's Smile Away." Our methods have been proven 100% effective since the school was founded (continues under) in 1993 by a fellow Australian... 
Candace: (whispers) Guys, it's me, Candace. We've come to bust you out of here. Now's our chance. (shouts) RUN! (to Sergeant) Just testing. Wow, you've done a great job of turning them into, uh...that.
Sergeant: Yes. Yes, we have.
Candace: Uh, yeah, I-I think we should really get some more footage of you.
Sergeant: Oh, really?
Candace: Oh, yeah. And you've got..."it," mister. So, uh, let's see. Uh, close your eyes.

Phineas: (Robotic voice) Escaping is wrong, and wrongness is bad.
Candace: We don't have time for this. Grab 'em! 
(Candace and Jeremy grab Phineas and Ferb and running off which they run past Linda and Lawrence who already came in) 
Linda: Why is Morty Williams running off with our children?
Lawrence: I don't know. 
(Alarms begin to go off)
Sergeant: Attention, all personnel. Two students have escaped with the help of Morty Williams, syndicated daytime talk show host. Weekday mornings. Check local listings for time and channel. (guard dogs barking) 
Candace: Come on, this way! 

Morty Williams: Yep, it's time to go back inside the Smile Away Reformatory School for more footage. Those zombified brats are making me one rich - (shouting; guard dogs barking; barking continues)

Candace: (gasps) I've got to buy us some time. 
Sergeant: It's Morty Williams! Get him!
Guards: Oh! Ow! Ow!
Sergeant: Hey, wait a minute. (picks up Baljeet's wig and the fake mustache) Look. They tricked us.
Guards: Get him! (guard dogs barking) Get him! 

Candace: We made it! Okay, guys, this is your department. Fix the car, quick!
Phineas: (Robotic voice) Age-inappropriate building is unsafe and irresponsible.
(Barking is heard)
Jeremy: (notices Sergeant and the guard dogs are almost coming) Uh, Candace?
Candace: We don't have to build anything. Just figure out how to fix it! I'm getting your toolbox. (gets the toolbox out of the Flying Car of the Future Today) See? Your tools! 
(Shuts the door which makes the Flying Car of the Future Today fall off of the ledge and the alarm wails)
Candace: A bridge! You can build a bridge across the ravine!
Phineas: Good boys don't make anything but their sisters happy.
Candace: Great, great. Make me happy. (puts Phineas and Ferb's helmets on them and grabs the wrench) Put on your helmet head systems, use your tools and do what you do best - build a bridge and Save Us!
Phineas: Creative acts are imitable and dangerous.
Candace: Listen to me, guys. Forget everything they told you. Creativity isn't bad. It's the best thing about you. (Sobbing) You two can do anything! And that's why I've always been secretly proud to be your older sister! What have I done?! What have I done?!
(Phineas blinks, then notices the wrench. He holds onto it and smiles. Candace smiles too.)
Phineas: (Normal voice) Hey, Ferb. (holds the wrench up high) I know what we're gonna do today!
Candace: Yes! They're back!
Sergeant: Too late. They're mine. (guard dogs barking) And so are you. (Candace gasps; rocks crumbling; Candace gasps again) 
Jeremy: (points to something) Look!

We see Perry and Dr. Doofenshmirtz battling on the giant robot spider. Perry takes off his fedora and smiles. Candace and her brothers are dumbfounded.)

Candace: Huh?
Baljeet: The real shock is you're just noticing this now.
Candace: What?
Talking Zebra: I'm just as confused as you are, Kevin.
Jeremy: Candace, since I have no idea what will happen next, I need to tell you something. (holds onto Candace's hand) I love you, Candace Flynn. Will you marry me?
Candace: Oh, Jeremy! I always dreamed... Wait a minute. That's it! I'm dreaming!
Jeremy: That would explain the talking zebra.
Candace: Nah. I see him all the time. This, this is actually the freaky part. And it's all just been one...big...

Candace: Dream! (pause) So none of that really happened. I never actually busted Phineas and Ferb. I am so happy. 
(The next morning at the breakfast table...)
Candace: And suddenly Mom, Dad and Baljeet were controlled by a giant puppet master!
Phineas: Cool.
Candace: Yeah, so I'm standing there, and Jeremy comes over and says (pauses to correct her words) certain things. And...

Candace: (Hoarsely) Poor Stacy. What was I thinking? Okay, Candace. Looks like it's up to you. (She gets off her bed. As she takes tiny steps her slippers squeak) 
(Doofenshmirtz's house in the suburbs)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, this is nice, eh? But, you know, I don't think suburban life is for me. I'm thinking of just adding a breakfast nook and flipping the property. The main problem is my neighbor, Phil. He is truly diabolical. His fruit falls into my yard, his dog poops on my lawn, he leaves his trash cans out too long, and... Oh, I'm at my wit's end! And the worst, the absolute worst, is his leaf blower.
Okay, that's it! Time to end this once and for all! And no one is stopping me!
Behold, Perry the Platypus! The ultimate suburban weapon: the Atomic Leaf Blower-inator! This will be the last time his stray leaves blow onto my lawn.
Yah! Aahh! Turn it off! Turn it off!
Good, just like planned. Now, I'll blow every leaf onto his property! Ha-ha-ha-ha--ha-ha! 
Candace: (Hoarsely) At least the golf course can't vanish if they're still in it. Come on, Mom. 
Doofenshmirtz: Curse you, Phil the Neighbor! 
(Crash) 
(In Linda's car)
Linda: Candace, what are you doing out of bed? Wasn't Stacy taking care of you?
Candace: (Hoarsely) She was seduced by the coolness. Follow that miniature golf course!
Linda: What does that even mean?
Candace: (Hoarsely) Look behind you!
Linda: I don't see anything. 
(At Little Duffers)
Farmer's wife: You know you should've been setting aside a portion of your profits over the years with the understatement that money would be used to upgrade your vestment. What did you think? A shiny new miniature golf course would just fall out of the sky?
Owner: You'd be surprised what falls out of the sky in Danville.
Linda: Oh, isn't that great? They remodeled Little Duffers.
Phineas: I still don't know how we ended up at Little Duffers.
Ferb: I don't know why we didn't build it here in the first place.
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry.
Stacy: Candace! Did you hear? I won! I actually won in miniature golf! It just goes to show you that if you focus, you can accomplish anything. (Sneezes)
(The ending of the Phineas and Ferb Theme plays. Then the music suddenly stops)

Candace: Jeremy is so cute, especially when he's in his Mr. Slushy Dog Uniform.
Linda: Candace, My jazz trio has a gig at the Squat 'n Stitch today. Why don't you, Phineas and Ferb hang out at the mall together?
Candace: The mall? (Ding) I can visit Jeremy at Mr. Slushy Dog!

(At the Googolplex Mall)
Linda: (with her jazz trio in a gig at Squat 'n Stitch) Testing. Welcome everyone, uh, we'll be playing some free-formed jazz today. It might get a little crazy, so, hold on to those knitting needles. (Plays triangle) Hit it, girls!
(Linda's trio starts playing jazz music. Meanwhile, in the food court...)
Candace: Alright, squirts. Here's your cut. I'll see you back here in 2 hours. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to Mr. Slushy Dog.
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?

(Meanwhile, Perry backs up against the side of the drink machine, makes sure no one's looking, and puts on his fedora. He then scans his foot and goes down a slide to his lair, but it is squeaky and Perry is forced to slide himself to the end)
Major Monogram: Sorry about that, Agent P. Our slide waxing guy has jury duty this weekend. Anyhow, Doofenshmirtz has purchased some suspicious items: 4 helicopter blades, 2 dozen party balloons, and light bulbs. 6000 of them. He's hiding out at the old abandoned cake factory on the edge of t-- Carl, the light bulb and the "6000". Still on the screen. (The light bulb and x6000 disappear) Ah, thanks, Carl. Locate Doofenshmirtz and figure out what he's up to. Don't fail us, Agent P.

Jeremy: Oh, hey Candace.
Candace: Heh. My cell phone appears to be ringing. (Snapshot) Whoops! My camera went off! (Giggling)

(Meanwhile, the boys is in the food court; and Ferb records how long it took for the top scoop to drop)
Phineas: Well, that was an interesting experiment.
Baljeet: Excuse me, but why are you not studying?
Phineas: It's summer vacation. You know, no school, and teachers aren't around, and all you have to worry about are bullies? (At this moment, Buford comes, sits on Baljeet, shoves his books aside, drinks his drink, crumples it up, and throws it behind him which hits a kid) Eh, Buford? That seat's kinda taken.
Buford: This table's taken. Sit somewhere else.
Phineas: What about Baljeet?
Baljeet: (Muffled) Please go. You will just make him angry.
(At that mnoment, Phineas' ice cream falls on Buford)
Buford: Aiee! (everyone laughs at Buford, causing him to get angry and grab Phineas) This is gonna hurt.
Isabella: Hey! Put him down!
Baljeet: Do as she says! (Buford pulls Baljeet from under him) Violence can only lead to more violence.
Buford: Sounds good to me.
Man: Hold it!
Isabella: World heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield?
Phineas: Aren't you a little old to be a professional boxer?
Evander: Yes. Yes I am.
Phineas: Cool.
Evander: If you have to fight, do it time-honored way, out behind the mall at 3:00.
Phineas: Uh, Ferb. How's our 3:00? (Ferb checks his book and gives a thumbs-up) We'll be there.
Buford: (drops Phineas) Don't be late. My mom's pickin' me up at 4:00.
Phineas: It looks like we found something to do today.
Baljeet: What you have found is a One-way magic carpet ride to your own destruction.
Isabella: He's right. Remember what happened to the last kid Buford fought?

(In a very brief flashback, a boy is shown with a toilet on his head)
Boy: (muffled) You win this round, Buford.

Doofenshmirtz: (Laughs) Perry the Platypus! I trapped you in a giant bowl filled to the brim with Doonkelberry cake mix. You see, Today is my birthday! Struggle all you want, Perry the Platypus. But in 30 to 40 minutes, the yeast will rise, and you'll be buried alive! Here, have some. Unfortunately, my birthday has always been the lousiest day of the year. It all began on the day of my actual birth... (Flashback of baby Doofenshmirtz being born in a hospital) Both of my parents failed to show up. (Cut to 5 year old Doofenshmirtz who uncovers his eyes) By the age of 5, I was forced to throw my own surprise party... at Gunther Goat Cheese's: The goat-cheesiest place in all of Druselstein. Many of my closest friends were there: Count Wolfgang, Betty the She-Boar, Raputin, and the licekins, Olga and Chicago Joe. (The scene pans to the animals, including Olga and Chicago Joe, who were Candace's Coaches from "Lights, Candace, Action!").
Employee: Hello, Boys and—Oh. Hmm... Awkward. Uh, Hey kid, lock up when you're done, okay? (Slams door)
Doofenshmirtz: But one should never walk the paths of Druselstein. With uncovered Doonkelberry cake, lest the Doonkelberry bats swarm.
Young Doofenshmirtz: (Screams)
(Flashback ends)
Doofenshmirtz: But this year, I won't be celebrating my birthday alone. Behold, The Slave-inator! You see, the crowd will do whatever the Slave-inator tells them to do! (he types some keys and the word CLAP appear on the inator; Agent P claps) I even have a Cleanup party button, (CLEAN UP PARTY MESS appears on the screen; Agent P picks up the cake) because the worst part of a party is the cleanup, am I right? (helicopter blades lift the Slave-inator) Farewell, Perry the Platypus, and happy birthday to me!

Stacy: What do you think your brothers are doing right now?
Candace: Who cares?
(Scene opens up with the camera zooming into the backyard.)
Phineas: So, Ferb, what do you wanna do today?
(Ferb shrugs.)
Phineas: What about Perry? What does he want to do?
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: Well, he's a platypus. They don't do much. I, for one, am starting to get bored, and boredom is something up with which I will not put! The first thing they're gonna ask us when we get back to school is "what did we do over the summer?". I mean, no school for three months. Our life should be a rollercoaster! And I mean a good rollercoaster. Not like that one we rode at the state fair...
(Flashback on a rollercoaster at the state fair. It goes over one tiny hill then ends.)
Fair Worker: Please exit to the left.
(End flashback.)
Phineas: Man, that was lame. Why, if I built a rollercoaster, I would... (Gets idea; angelic chorus plays) That's it! I know what we're gonna do today!
Linda: Phineas, Ferb. I'm gonna pick up a few things. You boys stay out of trouble, okay?
Phineas: Okay, Mom. (At Ferb) We're gonna build a rollercoaster!
(Linda gets into the car; Candace comes over.)
Candace: I'm in charge, right? You did tell them I'm in charge?
Linda: Relax, Candace, nobody has to be in charge.
Candace: But what if there's an emergency?
Linda: Like what?
Candace: What if a... What if a satellite falls out of orbit and crashes into the house? (smiles)
Linda: If that happens, you're in charge.
Candace: Yes!
Candace: (she enters into the backyard) Mom says I'm in charge, conditionally.
(Phineas and Ferb are working on something.)
Phineas: (not listening) Whatever.
Candace: Wait a minute, what are you doing?
Phineas: Homework.
Candace: It's summer.
Phineas: That's cool, you wait till the last minute then.
Candace: Well, I'm watching you. (Goes through the door) And I'm in charge—conditionally!
(Candace walks into the house and the phone rings, which she answers.)
Candace: Hello? Oh, hi, Stacy! No, I can't get to the mall right now. Mom just went to the store, she left me in charge, well, you know, conditionally.
(Phineas and Ferb walk past with lots of wooden planks.)
Candace: And if you go, can you see if Jeremy is there? No, no, he's the cute one that works at Mr. Slushy Burger.
(Phineas and Ferb walk past again, with steel beams.)
Candace: Yeah, he totally smiled at me the last time I was there. I just about died. No, I told you I can't, I'm watching my brother and stepbrother.
(Phineas and Ferb walk past with sinks and toilets.)
Candace: Yeah, and they never get into trouble, 'cause Mom never catches them. One of these days though, I'm going to see that she catches them red handed.
(Phineas and Ferb walk past again, with a flamingo and a lion that roars loudly.)
Candace: Will you hold it down, I am trying to use the phone! (at Stacy) Mom left me in charge, so there will be no shenanigans today. What are they doing right now? Why do you ask? What do you mean you can see it from your house? See what?!
(Candace runs out to the backyard, she stares in shock upon seeing the rollercoaster, along with horror music.)
Candace: Phineas, what is this?!
Phineas: Do you like it?
Candace: (gets angry) Ooh, I'm gonna tell Mom, and when she sees what you're doing, you are going down! (runs off) Down! Down! Down! D-O-W-N, down!
(Phineas and Ferb look blankly while she walks away.)
Phineas: We're gonna need a blowtorch and some more peanut butter.
(Candace takes her bicycle and rides away.)
Isabella: Hey Candace, is Phineas... home?
Candace: Down, down, I say!
(Isabella walks into the backyard.)
Isabella: (hearts in eyes) Hey, Phineas.
Phineas: Hey, Isabella.
Isabella: What'cha doin'?
Phineas: Building a roller coaster.
Isabella: In your backyard?
Phineas: Some of it.
Isabella: Wow. Isn't that kind of impossible?
Phineas: Some might say.
Isabella: Hey, Ferb.
(Ferb waves with the hammer.)
Isabella: Does your stepbrother ever talk?
Phineas: Ferb? He's more of a man of action.
(Ferb hits the nail and then his nose.)
Isabella: I was gonna go to the pool, you wanna go swimming?
Phineas: Kind of in the middle of something here.
Isabella: Oh, right. Okay, I'll see you later then. (leaves)
Phineas: Okay. (at Ferb) Hey, Ferb! You got enough rivets up there?
(Ferb gives a thumbs up showing they have rivets.)
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?
(Perry walks around the corner of the house. He jumps up, puts on a fedora and walks into a hole in the wall. He goes down a lift, into a lair, where he gets an "Incoming Message".)
Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. For reasons unknown to us, he bought up 80% of the country's tin foil. I want you to get over to his hideout right away. Find out what he's up to and put a stop to it. As always Agent P, it is important that your cover identity as a mindless domestic pet remains intact. Now, get out there. We're all counting on you.
(Agent P jumps into a platypus-themed hovercraft, and flies tough a tunnel. He leaves through a stone and holds his fedora down to hide from Phineas and Ferb.)
Phineas: So, the way I see it, the fuel rockets kick in at the mall's parking lot, then we release the snakes during the corkscrew at the interstate. I'm gonna go get the snakes.
(Ferb puts on his mask and starts using the blowtorch.)
(Candace runs into the store)
Candace: Mom! You gotta come home, right now.
Linda: Did a satellite crash into the house?
Candace: No, no, no. You gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing.
Linda: Seems like we've had this conversation before.
Candace: What do you mean?
Linda: I seem to recall you telling me that the boys were training monkeys to juggle bicycles, and when I come home, there was a stunning lack of monkeys.
Candace: I still don't know how they cleaned that up so fast.
Linda: So, what's the emergency this time?
Candace: They're building a roller coaster!
Linda: Candace, seriously, isn't Phineas a little young to be a roller coaster engineer?
(Phineas talks to a man in a car factory.)
Factory Manager: Aren't you a little young to be a roller coaster engineer?
Phineas: Yes. Yes, I am.
Factory Manager: Well, I must say, I'm very impressed, the forms all seems to be in order, although I'd never seen them filled out in crayon before. So, if there's anything I can get you, anything at all, just let me know.
Phineas: Do you think we could borrow one of those gadgets?
(A robot arm fixing a car is shown)
(Phineas and Ferb is riding the roller coaster that builds by the robot arm.)
Phineas: Now, this is the life.
(The camera zooms in on Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated.)
(Agent P swings into the building)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus, what an unexpected surprise. And by unexpected, I mean: COMPLETELY EXPECTED!
(Doofenshmirtz presses a button, which activates arms that grabs Agent P.)
Doofenshmirtz: I, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have covered the entire eastern seaboard in tin foil, and when I put my giant magnet, next to my genius, Magnetism Magnifier, I will pull the East, in westerly direction, thereby reversing the rotation of the earth. You may ask yourself, why would he do this? What could he possibly have to gain? Well, let me just answer that question, I haven't really worked on all the bugs yet. I mean, tin foil alone costs a lot.
(Back at the store)
Candace: But, Mom, I'd tell you, they're building it, and it's huge!
(Ferb puts up a poster, Candace comes over to read it.)
Candace: "Phineas and Ferb present the Coolest Coaster Ever now open"? Mom! (runs off)
Pedro: Phineas and Ferb got a roller coaster? You think we get a discount if we bring the flier?
Dimitri: Maybe we better take it.
(They take it with them just as Candace brings Linda over.)
Candace: (Gestures toward the empty post, head turned away) There, look, look, look, see? I told you I'm not crazy, I told you!
Linda: (dryly) And you're not crazy because...?
(Candace turns toward the post where the poster was and screams.)
Linda: I see your point, Candace. No crazy person would scream at a post like that. I'll be at the dairy section if you wanna come yell at some cheese, or anything. (leaves)
(At the Flynn-Fletcher house, where the start of the coaster and a stage is. Ferb lets the kids into a tent and walks onto a stage up to the microphone as if he's about to speak, then steps out of the way as Phineas comes up. He grabs the microphone as disco lights shine and rock music plays.)
Phineas: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages! May I present to you a spectacle most of the morning in the making: The Coolest...Coaster...EVER!!!
(Ferb reveals the coaster. A bird files into it.)
Phineas: So, who wants to go first?
(Everyone raises their hands.)
(On the rollercoaster...)
Phineas: To fasten, insert the tab into the metal buckle. To release, just pull back on the—oops.
(Phineas drops the safety belt.)
Phineas: Well, you get the picture. Well, that's about it. Enjoy the ride.
(The car goes over the top, and stops, viewing the long drop.)
Phineas: You all signed the waivers, right?
(Down it goes; the car goes around the coaster, on the track. Everyone screams.)
(Going through the drop of snakes)
Phineas: Relax, they're just rubber!
(The car goes into a bucket of mud, then exits. Later, it goes through a car wash, to be cleaned from the mud.)
Phineas: Hey, look, there comes the AH-AH-AH-AH!
(The track is going up and down repeatedly, creating four "AH"s.)
(The car zooms around the Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated building.)
Doofenshmirtz: ...I really make of my money back, I-I-I want a really spacey real estate, and sell it again.
(Agent P sends a screw at Doofenshmirtz, which he ducks for.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ha! You missed!
(The screw flies to the roof and hitting a line, which throws it back at Doofenshmirtz's foot.)
Doofenshmirtz: Aaaoow!! Ow, Ow, Ow, Aaooww!
(Doofenshmirtz jumps around and accidentally releases Agent P, who quickly attacks him.) (Agent P hits Doofenshmitz's foot.) Aaaoow!! (During the fight, Doofenshmirtz activates the Magnetism Magnifier.)
Doofenshmirtz: Now you are too late! Quake in your boots and watch helplessly, as the unimaginable electromagnetic forces, pull the eastern seaboard, thereby reversing the rotation of the Ea--
(All the tin foil releases from the buildings)
Doofenshmirtz: Well... that didn't work.
(The tin foil forms into a giant ball, flying through the air)
Doofenshmirtz: And now, we have a two-ton ball of tin foil traveling 200 miles per hour directly at us! Quickly, we must separate the magnet from the Magnifier before it's too late!
(At the store)
Linda: Now I know I have that club card in here somewhere. I always have it with me, but my purse is a disaster area, you know how it is.
(Candace goes outside and sees the coaster)
Candace: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Mom? Mom!? (She rushes off.)
(Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated building)
Doofenshmirtz: It's no use! It's no use! We are doomed!
(Agent P sees a helicopter. He jumps onto the magnet and fires a grappling hook at it. He quickly wraps some of the rope around the magnet. The helicopter flies off, taking the magnet with it.)
Doofenshmirtz: You did it! You saved us, Perry the Platypus! (The ball of tin foil crashes through the building.) Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
(The magnet pulls a piece of the Magnetism Magnifier onto it, and gets stuck on the coaster, which then follows the helicopter into the sky.)
(Candace pulls Linda into the parking lot, not noticing the coaster has been removed.)
Candace: Look, look, look, see?
Linda: (pause) Okay, I give up, what am I supposed to be looking at?
Candace: (turns to see the empty parking lot) No!! It's not POSSIBLE!!!
Linda: (going back inside) I'm gonna go get the cart.
Candace: IT WAS RIGHT HERE AND IT WAS HUGE!!! (sees the rollercoaster fly away) MOM!
Linda: (walks past, taking her cart) Time to go. I've got frozens.
Candace: Okay, so you think that Phineas and Ferb are still under that stupid tree in the backyard, right?
Linda: Well, yes, that would be my guess.
Candace: Fine, then let's go home, now! (She pushes the cart.)
(Agent P sees that the helicopter is smoking and cuts the rope. He drops down onto the coaster and in the cart, right behind Phineas and Ferb.)
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry.
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: Nice hat, Isabella.
(Isabella takes off Agent P's fedora and looks at it, confused.)
(The car goes to the end of the track and flies onto a construction area and flings into the air.)
Phineas: Funny, I don't remember this in the blueprints.
(An airplane picks up the car by the tail)
Phineas: And I'm sure this is new.
(Candace sees the airplane from Linda's car.)
Candace: Hehehehehehehehehehe!
Linda: I worry about you sometimes, Candace.
(The coaster car drops down and onto the Statue of Liberty, bending and throwing it to the woods. It lands on a pine tree which bends so they end up in front of Mr Slushy Burger.)
Jeremy: Welcome to Mr. Slushy Burger, may I take your order?
Phineas: Anyone want fries?
(Before taking any orders, the tree bends back and throws them to France, Paris)
French Man: Croissant?
Phineas: Anyone want a... (French accent) "quasson"?
(The car gets flung into orbit)
Singing Voice: ♪ Aahh-Aahh-Aaahhh ♪
(A satellite flies by)
Phineas: You know, if that thing crashes into earth, Candace is in charge.
(The car suddenly falls down towards earth, towards the Tri-State area. The front of the car begins to burn like a meteor.)
Phineas: We should have charged more.
(Linda pulls the car on the driveway and Candace jumps out.)
Linda: Okay, we're here, are you happy now, Candace?
(Horror music plays; Candace opens the gate to the backyard and doesn't see Phineas or Ferb.)
Candace: Yes! (At Linda) See, Mom? I told you they weren't there!
(Candace opens the gate and gestures toward the tree with her eyes closed, as we hear a sound of leaves rustling. Linda pokes her head through the gate opening and smiles.)
Linda: Oh, hi, boys.
(Candace opens her eyes and her mood changes to shock; cut to under the tree to show Phineas and Ferb are suddenly here.)
Phineas: Hi, Mom.
Linda: Come on Candace, help me with the groceries. (goes off)
Candace: But, but, but, but, but, but, but... (Continues under)
Linda: (comes back) Let's go. (pulls her away)
(Kids drop down from the tree.)
Kid: Hey Phineas, that was great.
Pedro: Way too cool.
Third kid: That was awesome! Can we do it again?
Phineas: Sorry, only one ride per customer.
(Isabella comes down from the tree.)
Isabella: That was great, Phineas. So, what are you gonna do tomorrow?
Phineas: Don't know yet.
Isabella: (pets Perry) Maybe you could teach Perry some tricks.
Phineas: Well, he is a platypus, they don't do much.
Ferb: They're the only mammals to lay eggs.
(Pause)
Phineas: ...Maybe he'll lay an egg.
Isabella: Cool. See you tomorrow. (goes to the gate) It really was the coolest coaster ever. You guys make a great team.
Phineas: Well, a brother is a brother, but I couldn't have asked for a better one than Ferb. You know what I mean?
(Ferb burps rudely)
Phineas: Oh-ho-ho, man! I could smell the peanut butter!
Isabella: Well, that was impressive. See you, guys. (leaves)
Phineas: So, what should we do tomorrow? There's a world of possibilities. (pause) Maybe we should make a list!
(The coaster car explodes in the tree, a car alarm and a dog barking can be heard.)
Candace: (from inside) Mom!!
Linda: (from inside) Give it a rest, Candace!

Gaston Le Mode (on TV): Behold! Feast your eyes upon the fashion of the future!
(In the living room, Candace is watching TV; Phineas walks by.)
Phineas: Hey, Candace. (said in the same manner as Isabella) What'cha waaaatchin'?
Candace: Only the latest looks from the world's greatest fashion designer, Gaston Le Mode.
Phineas: I don't get it. Why would anyone want to wear goofy looking clothes?
Candace: It's not goofy! Fashion designers create art. That people live in.
Phineas: Hmm. I never thought of it that way. (At Ferb) Ferb, put the Cold Fusion Reactor on hold!
Ferb: (Pulls lever)
Phineas: I know what we're gonna do today!

Major Monogram: 1, 2, 3, testing, testing, 1, 2, 3-- (Camera shows that he is not wearing pants) Agent P, you're early! Carl, cut to close up! (Camera zooms in; to Perry) Oh. (Clears throat) Basically, Doofenshmirtz has been acting up again. He's stockpiling the usual strange and unrelated things. This time, it's copy machines and ink cartridges by the thousands. We need you to find out what's going on right away.
(In the backyard)
Phineas: Okay, Ferb. If we're gonna tackle this fashion design thing, we've gotta do something really special. It has to be cool. Comfortable. And undetectable by radar. Something that absolutely screams summer! Ah, I think you're on to something, Ferb!
Isabella: (enters) Hey, Phineas. What'cha dooooin'?
Phineas: Ferb and I are working on designs for our new clothing line. Take a look at what we've got so far.
Isabella: Very impressive! Need any help? (Shows the Fireside Girls holding dressmaking equipment) The Fireside Girls and I are trying to get our sewing badges.

(At Googolplex Mall)
Candace: There it is; The world's most famous runway of Gaston Le Mode. Oh, Stacy, can you imagine the glamorous life of a supermodel?
(She begins to daydream. Snapshots; Crowd cheering)
Supermodel Candace: Hi, I'm Candace. I'm sure you recognize me from my countless magazine covers. You know, being a supermodel is hard work; The bright lights, the deafening applause, and all those paper cuts from counting my huge stacks of money. That's why I start every morning with Candace Os.
Man: Candace Os. Part of a nutritious breakfast.
(Back to reality)
Stacy: Candace?
Candace: What?
Stacy: Candace Os?
Candace: (Sighs) I really shouldn't fantasize on an empty stomach.
Man #2: (Gasps)
Gaston Le Mode: Finally! After years of bitter struggle, I, Gaston Le Mode, have created the ultimate design; The ne plus ultra in haute couture. But alas, I cannot find a single model with a neck long enough to complement my design.
Woman: Sorry, Gaston, but only someone with a freakishly long neck could fit into--
Gaston Le Mode: Yes. Everyone is sorry. Where will I find that swan-like neck?
Man #2: Pardon, Monsieur, I have great news!
Gaston Le Mode: (excitedly) A Jerry Lewis marathon on TV tonight?

I did it myself, it's a silhouette of me going... (Laughs maniacally; Pushes button) All right, let's see, now. (Ding) Oh, needs a little more toner. Oh, copy jam.
Doofenshmirtz #2: Uh...

Candace: (blushes) Oh, why, thank you!
Gaston Le Mode: Now, wait right here while I introduce you to the crowd.
Delivery Guy: Package for Gaston Le Mode.
Gaston Le Mode: (excitedly) Is it a poster of Jerry Lewis?
Delivery Guy: I wish!
Gaston Le Mode: All right, all right. But this better be important. (unrolls the paper) Ooh! Gasp! This design! It's comfortable. Cool. And undetectable by radar. It absolutely screams summer!
Candace: This isn't new! I've seen this before!
Gaston Le Mode: Do you know who designed it?
Phineas: We did, sir. It's part of the Summer All The Time collection.
Gaston Le Mode: C'est magnifique!
Candace: What are you guys doing here?
Phineas: It's all thanks to you, Candace. We thought fashion design was lame, but you convinced us to give the glamor world a chance.
Candace: But-but-but-but--
Gaston Le Mode: Mademoiselle, Candace, there has been a change in plans. You will wear this on, s'il vous plait.
Candace: I-I-I--
Gaston Le Mode: Or you could wear this.
Candace: Not in this life! Sayonara, amigo! (stomps across the runway in anger) I am so telling Mom, and you guys are so busted! (falls into the crowd) I'm okay!
(Cut back to Gaston)
Gaston Le Mode: But mademoiselle! Sigh. Okay, ladies, time to get changed and strut your stuff.
Women: Thank you, Gaston.

Gaston Le Mode: Ladies and Gentlemen, I, Gaston Le Mode, am proud to present this stunning new collection: Summer All The Time.

Gaston Le Mode: You are on fire.

Candace: When Mom hears about this-- (Sees two people) Hey, wait a minute. Where did you get those outfits?
Woman #3: These? Why, these are the only latest hit designs from the Summer All The Time collection. Everybody's wearing them. I mean, jeez, where you been?
Candace: "Phineas and Ferb, The Kings of Couture!"? That was fast.
Stacy: Candace? There you are!
Candace: Stacy?
Stacy: You left your cell phone and your clothes in there.
Candace: (Gasps) Stacy? You too?! You look just like Ferb!
Stacy: Wow, thanks, Candace! Most of this is a genuine label, but the shoes are a total knockoffs. I heard there's a riot Uptown at this one store that got a fresh shipment. I gotta run before they sell out. Bye! Oh, and Candace? Friendly tip; That Gaston stuff is so 42 seconds ago.
Candace: (Growls)

Doofenshmirtz: You see, Perry the Platypus, a whole army of Doofenshmirtzs! Perfect copies of me!

Doofenshmirtz #8: Now I have two!
(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz) Doofenshmirtz: Aren't they adorable? How about you jump, and fetch me something too, huh? Something like, um, your doom?
Doofenshmirtz #2: Hey, don't hurt the little bunny rabbit.
Doofenshmirtz: How did you get out of the trash, you drop-out bohemian? (To Perry) I'll be right back. I've got some deleting to do. That's right, tremble, my rejected friend. (accidentally presses the "Delete All" button) Oh no! I pushed the "Delete All" button by mistake!
(At the Googoplex Mall, all the Doofenshmirtz's disappear from existence)
Doofenshmirtz: Look what you made me do! Oh, guess who's paying for this! (Perry ties Doof's hands with the duct tape) What is this? (Perry jumps out) Hey, why did you jump out that-- (Gasps) Oh, you clever, little plat-- (gets dragged out) Well, that wasn't very bright!

Linda: (flatly) Oh, I think I'm looking at it...
Candace: Look, Mom! You see?!! (Points, then, after a moment, looks downward, deadpanned)
(Horror music plays)
Linda: So you dragged me all the way down here for a...pharmacist convention?
(Horror music stops. Candace looks at the people in lab coats, then grins sheepishly at Linda)
(Cut to Gaston and the kids)
Gaston Le Mode: Face it, mon ami, your designs are 3 minutes and 37 seconds ago.
Phineas: Oh, well. We had a great time. Hey, Gaston? What's with the new outfit?
Gaston Le Mode: Are you kidding? No one's claiming this look yet! I have to get out in front of this thing and take credit for it all. That's how you stay in business, kid. Au revoir!
Isabella: Well, Phineas, I still like your style.
Phineas: Thanks. (To Linda) Hi, Mom!
Linda: Oh, look. We're all here. Why don't we get some lunch? (leaving) I think there's a pizza place right over there.
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry.
Candace: Yeah, go ahead. Eat all you want. My dreams are smashed to pieces, and all you can think of is food! Well, just remember, Gaston said I'll always be his Cou de Crayon.

Phineas: Uh...we don't know...it's too hot to think...
Lawrence: Yeah, mom and I are getting rid of a few old things at the antique store, but I think I've got just what you need. A snow cone machine just like when I was a kid!
Phineas: How does it work?
Lawrence: Well, you pour the ice in here, you give it a crank, add some syrup, and Bob's your uncle; ♪ Snow cones for everyone ♪
Linda: Honey? We need to go. The antique show closes in just 12 hours.
Lawrence: Okay, kids. I'll leave you in charge of the machine. And be easy on your sister? She's been a bit on edge lately. (The car pulls out of the driveway while Candace looks on in suspicion)
Phineas: Wow. Snow in July. (Angelic chorus) That's it! I know what we're going to do today! We're gonna need a lot more ice.
Candace: What is all this?
Phineas: It's a snow cone! You want some?
Candace: You mean crushed ice covered blue carbs? Lame.
Phineas: Maybe Perry wants some. Hey, where's Perry?
(Cut to Perry, who puts on his fedora and goes down the secret entrance to his lair)
Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. I'll get right to it. This time, we're worried about Doofenshmirtz buying laser pointers. I mean, 2 or 3 of them would be fine, but he just put in an order for 18,000 of them?! Only a crazed, evil and diabolical mind would do that. Sure you'll know what to do, Agent P.

Ferb: It's a unique logic-defying amalgam of Winter and Summer.
Phineas: Why have snow in the winter when it's too cold to enjoy it?
Isabella: You guys are gonna need some help. (Whistles; the Fireside Girls appear to help)

Phineas: Why do they call it "Badbeard Lake"?
Clyde: Well, it's a body of fresh water surrounded by land―
Phineas: No, the "Badbeard" part.
Clyde: Oh, right.
It was named after "Badbeard", the most ruthless freshwater pirate ever to plunder a lakeside community.
Kids: Cool!
Clyde: And in the middle of Badbeard Lake lies Spleen Island, where legend has it Badbeard buried his bountiful booty. Heh!
Phineas: Booty?
Clyde: You know, treasure
Kids: (Gasps) "Treasure"?
Clyde: Aye, mateys- Oh, just a sec. (Marker squeaks) Arrrgh!
Phineas: Why are you talking like a pirate, Grandpa?
Clyde: Arrrgh! I'm trying to tell the story of Badbeard the Pirate.
There's a song about it. Say, does anyone have a concertina? Buford?

Clyde: You see kids, wherever you go, the forest is teeming with life for us to step on.
Remember, always stick to the trail so you won't get lost.

Candace: Boring. I'm calling Stacy.
Clyde: Left is right. Right is wrong.
Candace: I can't get any reception up here.
Clyde: So stay clear of the orange moss.
The slightest touch, and the orange moss will absorb through the skin, causing wild hallucinations.
Candace: Huh? Oh no! Was that the right side or the wrong side? No, wait. The left side was the right side.
(Gasps) Moss! Orange! (Screams; Runs off)
Clyde: Thar she blows mateys. Badbeard Lake.

Good luck, Agent P.

I was just about your age when I first heard about Badbeard's treasure.
I'd come up here every summer and search for it.
But I felt drawn by the excitement and adventure.
Of course, then I discovered girls and the rest is a blur.
I never found the treasure, but I did find a treasure map.
Buford: Treasure map? Hey!
Baljeet: (Laughs) Woah!
Clyde: But be warned, mateys. They say Badbeard's treasure comes with a curse.
Kids: "A curse"?
Clyde: Aye! Them who disturb the treasure of Badbeard shall be cursed with bad beards for the rest of their days.
Phineas: You mean we'll be stuck with a big, ugly beard on our face for the rest of our lives?
Buford: That's gnarly.
Clyde: Well, while you kids search for treasure, I better go search for Grandma. Wish there was a map for that.

Phineas: Okay, troops.
We set sail from Point Plots, sail through the Stones of Gall, and into the Cove of Incontinence, and then continue on foot into the Dark Tunnel of Doom.
Well, that sounds delightful. And "X" marks the spot. Easy-peasy.
First thing we gotta do is, we make Grandpa's secondhand dingy into a first-rate pirate ship.

Betty Jo: I guess it was all in your head.
Well, that's the power of suggestion for you. You get some rest now, sweetie.
Candace: The blue moss. What? Ohh.
Talking Zebra: (Appears out of nowhere, knitting) Love the beard, Kevin.
(Scene opens up showing a sunrise.)
(Alarm clock rings)
Phineas: Beat you to it again, slow poke. (Laughs) Hey, Ferb. Ready to build the fastest, safest, most on-time backyard railroad ever?
(Ferb puts on a railroad hat)
Phineas: All right! You man the boiler, I'll handle the brakes. Perry can be the station's mascot.
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: Wow. It's really nice out today. It's almost like everything in nature is simultaneously saying:
Squirrel: Ahh!
Bird/Worm: Ahh!
Spider: Ahh!
Baby Spiders: Ahh!
Patient: Ahh.
Phineas: You know, Ferb, everyday we do something really big. But you know the one thing we haven't done? Relax. I say we take advantage of this perfect day and have the best do-nothing day ever.
Candace: Hey, Stacy. Yes, yes. I'm ready for Jeremy's band's outdoor concert at the summer festival! Today's gonna be amazing! (Clock ticks) (Sniffs) All right, what gives? It's already 9:00 and there's no construction noise, no delivery trucks, no-- (Bird chirps) No nothing? They're just standing there. Like statues. Statues...
Phineas (in Candace's mind): Good thinking, Ferb. We'll put these decoys up so Candace thinks we're doing nothing. Then, when Candace isn't looking, we'll do something! (Wicked laughter)
Candace: (Gasps) Not today, they don't!
Linda: Hi, boys. Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: We're doing nothing today.
Linda: Well, I'm off to the festival to set up my tea cozy stand. Bye!
Phineas: Bye, Mom! Hey, where's Perry?
(Garbage clattering)
(Dance music; record scratch)
Major Monogram: Oh, hey, Agent P. Carl, give me a close up. So, uh, anyway... Stop Doofenshmirtz. (at Carl) Hit it, Carl.
(Dance music)
(Scene shifts to the backyard)
Phineas: Hi, Candace.
Candace: I'm not here for "Hi's". Today is a pivotal moment in my life. You see, Jeremy's band is gonna play at the festival. Jeremy's gonna see me in the crowd. Not just because I have front row seats, but because I'm gonna be cheering harder that anyone else. Like this: "WOO! YEAH! WOO! BABY! OH YEAH, SING IT!" Then we're gonna date through high school and college, marry and have two kids: Xavier and Amanda. So don't you dare ruin it with one of your little project thingies!
Phineas: No problem, Candace. 'Cause today we're doing nothing anyway.
Candace: And don't try to give me—Did you say "Nothing"?
Phineas: Nothing.
Candace: (Gasps) Nothing?
Phineas: Nothing.
Candace: Standing is something.
Phineas/Ferb: (Slowly fall on their backs)
Candace: Hmm. Well, you can't do nothing forever. And when you stop doing nothing, I'll start doing something, and that something will be busting you! (Slams door) Look at them plotting my downfall. (Dials phone)
("I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun! Instrumental")
Linda: Hello?
Candace: Mom! Phineas and Ferb are doing nothing! Nothing, in a relentless effort to ruin my day!
Linda: Candace, honey, why can't you just relax, and let your brothers enjoy their do-nothing day?
Candace: Could it really be possible? Could Phineas and Ferb actually be doing nothing? You're right, Mom. I should just try and relax until Stacy picks me up for the concert.
Linda: Exactly. Love ya.
Candace: Well, If they really are doing nothing, I guess I've got some time to go about my personal business. Let's see... What do I usually do? I know! I'll call Stacy and tell her how I'm busting Phineas and Ferb for—Oh yeah, can't do that 'cause they're not doing anything. Wait a minute! I know! I'll put this camera in just the right spot so when Phineas and Ferb are—Ugh! And then when Phineas and Ferb walk by I'll—Ugh! Well, if there's one thing I know, I'm gonna look sooo good when I bust them for—Agh! Face it! You cant do anything unless you're trying to bust them for doing something. And if they're doing nothing, then... (Sobbing) "Who is Candace?"
Phineas: Ah...
(Paper rips)
Candace: Hey, Phineas. Is it the perfect day to build one of these or what?
Phineas: Sorry, Candace, it's like we said; We're pursuing the best do nothing day ever. But if you put it in our inbox, we'll try to build it tomorrow.
Candace: (Crumples blueprint) Ugh! (Rips out another blueprint) Huh, huh? Time traveling submarine? Come on!
Phineas: Candace, now you're just taking pages from our project book.
Candace: (Blushes) How can I inspire them to build something? Argh! (Turns on TV)
TV Announcer: Are you a boy, doing nothing with your stepbrother today? Do you like high adventure?
Boys: Yeah!
TV Announcer: Then we have the product for you! It's the Amazing Man-Eating Dinosaur-Themed Totally Sick Waterslide of Doom! That's right, kids. The Amazing Man-Eating Dinosaur-Themed Totally Sick Waterslide of Doom Can be delivered in just minutes! And it's so easy to assemble, even a 5-year-old can build it!
Boy: I did it!
TV Announcer: Call now!
Candace: (Dials phone)
Delivery Guy: There, that's the last of it. By the way, aren't you a little too old to be building one of these?
Candace: Why, yes. Yes I am. Okay, I'll get this thing started. And then because they're men, they'll want to take over and show me how to do it. Then I'll call Mom and bust them!

I don't know if you've ever noticed, but I'm not exactly very... Mmm, what do the kids call it these days? Handsome. My doctor says it's genetic, but I don't blame my parents. I blame everyone else in the entire Tri-State Area for being better-looking that me. So, I invented this. My Ugly-Inator! (Frog croaks) It harnesses the horned frog's unpleasant appearance to render it's target ugly! Let me give you a demonstration on handsome movie actor Vance Ward.
Vance: Hi, I'm Vance Ward.
Doofenshmirtz: If it can turn him ugly, it can turn anything ugly. Are you ready, Vance?
Vance: I guess, but I didn't get a script. I mean, what's my motivation in this scene?
Doofenshmirtz: Motivation? Oh, I think it will be clear to you in a second. (Shoots Vance with Ugly-Inator)

Doofenshmirtz: (Laughs) Now onto the rest of the Tri-State Area! Oh, and Perry the Platypus, you know what the best part of my plan is? I can do it from the comfort of my own living room! With my favorite flat-screen TV and recliner. (Sits on recliner) Ah...
Candace: Oh, hey, boys. I see you're still doing nothing. Oh, don't mind me. I'm just carrying a few construction supplies for a really huge super cool contraption. (Laughs) You know, like the ones you used to build. Well, I figured I'd get in on the fun today. Oh, pardon my reach! Just trying to get into the most convenient position to drive this stake into the ground. Oh yeah! I'm really having fun now!
Phineas: Uh, Candace?
Candace: Oh, I know what you're gonna say. Of course you can take over the whole operation.
Phineas: Uh, actually, I was gonna ask if you could keep the noise down.
Candace: Uh, well, back onto the important things in life, like having fun! (In a cement truck) Remember when you used to have this much fun? (In a crane) All this fun could be yours too. All you have to do is join me! (Building the contraption; jackhammer clinking) Okay, okay, I don't want to brag, but fun loves me more than it loves you right now... (Cell phone rings)

Vance: (Deep, warped voice) Where am I?
Ferb: And with handsome movie actor Vance Ward. He seems much faster on TV.
(The camera zooms into the backyard of the Flynn-Fletcher house. Phineas and Ferb are lying against the tree with Perry aside them.)
Phineas: So Ferb, what should we do today?
I mean, besides giving Perry a bath.
(He and Ferb sniff at Perry.)
Perry: (Chatters)
(From beyond, a race car sound is heard against them)
Phineas: (peeking over the fence) What is that wonderful noise?
(Camera shows Jefferson County Motor Speedway, where the racing cars qualify for Swamp Oil 500, miles away from the house.)
Awesome. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!

(In the garage, they start to work on turning the family car into a race car. Candace walks past, construction coming from the garage door.)
Candace: Oh, I have got to take a new picture of myself for my blog. I didn't realize mine is already a week old.
(She takes a selfie; her new selfie is exactly the same as her old one.)
Candace: That's better.
(She walks off, but snaps back to the garage entrance as she notices the boys working on the car.)
Candace: WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MOM'S CAR?!
Phineas: (He and Ferb pop out of the hood.) We tricked it out!
Candace: You don't even know how to drive.
Phineas: Well, duh. That's why Ferb built this remote.
(Ferb activates the remote which activates the engine.)
Candace: (deeply) Oh, you are so busted.
(She exits the garage and starts opening and closing doors throughout the house.)
Candace: (offscreen; opens door) Mom?! (closes door, opens another) Mom?! (closes door, opens another) Mom?! (closes door, reenters garage with her awkward smike) Um, where's Mom?
Phineas: (as Ferb slams the engine in place) She's playing bridge at Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro's!
(Candace grins, then slips out. Ferb closes the hood.)

(Outside...)
Candace: Heh, they won't get away with it this time!
(Candace goes to the Garcia-Shapiro household and rings the doorbell. Briefly, she turns her head to face the house, raising her eyebrows sneakly. Vivian comes out.)
Vivian: Oh, Candace, dear. Bubela, how good to see you. What a coincidence. Do you know your mom is here?
(The boys are testing the car behind Candace.)
Candace: Mmm-mmm. Yeah, I do, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro. I need to talk to her if you don't mind.
Vivian: Oy-vey. Look how tall you are now. You must've grown a couple of inches since the last time I've saw you.
Candace: That was last week, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro.
Vivian: Well your mom's inside, dear. Where are your braces? I thought you were wearing braces.
Candace: Yeah. MOM! MOM! MOM! (runs inside)

Linda: What is it, Candace?
Candace: Oh, you have got to see what Phineas and Ferb are doing!

The first time, their hair is blown forward.
The second, their hair is burst.
Third, their hair is switched.
Fourth, their hair is normal again)

Candace: (gestures toward the boys) Quick!!
Phineas: Hi, Mom!
Linda: Hi, boys! (to Candace) Well, if that's all, I'll just be getting back to the game.
(Candace just stands there speechless and deadpanned. Just after Linda closes the door, the car thuds back onto the road.)
Phineas: Good thing we've beefed up the suspension.

(Ferb makes the car spin.)
Phineas: Woah! What else can it do?
Isabella: (Walks up; dreamy look and voice) Hi, Phineas.

We'll see you boys later.

Grandpa Reg: My boy, what's this behind your ear?
It's me scrapbook!
Phineas: How'd you do that?
Grandpa It's just a little bit of "How's you're father".
I may seem like a barmy ol' git now, but when I wasn't so long in the tooth, I had some grand larks and engaged in a fair amount of derring-do.
Phineas: Translate.
Ferb: When he was younger, he did a bunch of stuff.
Grandpa Reg: Here I am as a young lad.
I made my livin' work at the family Fish and Chips shop.
But I was destined for bigger things.
I was known as The Great Flying Fishmonger.
Here's my first jump over my dear mum's tea society.

But there was one jump that haunts me to this day; McGregor's Gorge of Doom.

Grandpa Reg: (Narrating) People turned out by the thousands to witness me in my trusty motor bike, the Holy Mackerel, make our biggest jump yet. The event was so massive, I hired a local band to write me a theme song.
Band: (Dirge-like) ♪ He's a Fishmonger, and he flies ♪
Grandpa Reg: But it wasn't exactly a toe-tapper.
Then all of a sudden, it started to rain. I had to postpone my great feat.
The second go at it weeks later had the same result!
And yet another attempt; nothing but blasted rain again.
Man: Let's go!
Woman: Yeah. I've got teeth not to brush.
(Flashback ends)

Grandpa Reg: Over the years, my eyesight went, and with the lumbago...
(Grunts) ...Sciatica...
(Creaking) ...Bursitis and... Wait for it...
(Boing!) Trick knee, jumpin' McGregor's Gorge is an intention lost to the past.
Phineas: Wow, Grandpa. So whatever happened to the Holy Mackerel?
Grandpa Reg: She's right over there.
Although I see your mother turned her into a lamp.
Phineas: Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!

Candace: Oh, Grandma, you're gonna love this mall!
I'll show you my favorite store, and there's this little dress that--

Who's the tiger?
Isabella: Hey, Phineas! Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Hey, Isabella. We're helping Grandpa Reg fulfill his crushed dreams.
Isabella: Where's Ferb?
Phineas: He's in the garage restoring the mackerel.
(Briefly, Ferb is seen working on the mackerel in the garage, he stops to eat a grilled cheese sandwich)
Isabella: Cool.
Well, I brought this cute little toy over for Perry. Where is he?
Phineas: Huh. I don't know.

Carl: Oh, hey, Agent P. Monogram's thrown his back out...
Major Monogram: I'm on the floor, Agent P.
Carl: ...so I'll be giving you your assignment, okay? Okay.
Major Monogram: Do a closeup.
Carl: Huh? Oh, yeah. Huh.

Bags of sand
and extra-long shoelace.
We know he's up to no good. Get out there and see what he's up to.

Major Monogram: Just hand me my pills, Carl.

Grandpa Reg: What's all the kerfuffle, lads?
Phineas: You can open your eyes now.
Grandpa Reg: (puts arms down, monocle falls off) Blimey! It's McGregor's Gorge and the Holy Mackerel! Ferb, you've restored my pride and joy! But, uh, I can't operate a motorbike in my condition. Remember the- (Boing!)
Phineas: No problem. Ferb's tricked out the whole bike. Lumbar support, padded seating, ergonomic controls, and the best part - Side cars! See, as much as we wanna help you fulfill your dream, we also really want to jump a gorge.

Candace: (wearing British clothes) Uh, can we get out of here, like, now? Before anyone I know happens to see--
Jeremy: Candace? I almost didn't recognize you.
Candace: Jeremy! I-- I, uh--
Jeremy: I gotta meet my Mom at the food court, but I'll see ya later.

Doofenshmirtz: Oh, just come in! Into my trap! Yes! Sticky flypaper, Perry the Platypus! (Laughs) Quick story? Back in Druselstein in the days of my youth, there was a bully named Boris, and he always wore big, black boots. They called him "Big Black Boots Boris". He was always kicking sand in my face. When I was in the sandbox; Sand. My first date; Sand! Balancing my checkbook; Sand! The beach-- Oddly enough nothing. But I couldn't relax, because I kept waiting for it. Now, though, he will be the one doing the waiting. Behold! The Now who'd blinded by sand-inator! Or maybe the Who's crying now-inator or, something like...something with the "Inator" suffix. In any case, it's a giant sand kicking machine! You see, Perry the Platypus, Boris has moved to the Tri-State Area, so now, I am going to cover his entire house in sand! (Laughs maniacally)

Candace: What? And let you fall? You may be a pain, but you are my brother. (She and Phineas hug) Besides, I still have that big rocket for evidence. What happened to the rocket? (Rocket explodes)
Phineas: Hmm. Good thing we got off of that, huh?
(Ferb arrives on a helicopter)
Candace/Phineas: All right, Ferb! You got the disk!
Candace: Cool!
Phineas: All right! (Ferb flies off)
Candace: Ferb? Ferb, where you going?
Phineas: Ferb?
(Ferb, covered in oil, slides down the opened drawbridge)
Ferb: What did I miss?
Candace: Huh?
Phineas: Well, that was almost weirder than the giant robot.

Candace: Wrestling, Mom. Favorite game.

Candace: Okay, whatever. Kinda busy right now.
Linda: Call if there's any trouble.
Candace: With my brothers, I'd might as well call now.

Male Teacher: A portal to Mars? And what does it do?
Baljeet: Well, without over-complicating things, it's a portal to Mars. You step through it and you're on Mars.
Male Teacher: Well, this is very...creative. But, unless you can build a working model, the best I can give you is...

(In Perry's lair)
Major Monogram: Oh, uh...Agent P. (Clears throat) It appears that Doofenshmirtz has made some rather unusual purchases. Chicken wire, three metric tons of baking soda and lederhosen. You know those leather bib-front shorts that make you look like a walking cuckoo clock? (Pauses) Man, he is one sick puppy.
(In Baljeet's room)
(Montage; Indian music plays in background)
Phineas: You're all set for the science fair tomorrow.
Baljeet: Inside I am thanking you a thousand times, even though on the outside I remain quite frugal.
(Next morning at the Googolplex Mall...)
Phineas: Wow, Baljeet, you're already set up.
Baljeet: (With a wide smile "frozen" on his face) I have been here since midnight waiting for everyone! I can't stop smiling! I have got cramps in my cheeks.
Phineas: Here, let me help you. There you go, buddy
Baljeet: Ahh. Now I'll just hang out and "be cool" till my teacher gets here. (Wide smile appears on his face) Uh-oh, it is happening again!
(Scene switches to Candace, who's spying on Jeremy via a pair of binoculars...)
Candace: Oh, yeah, Jeremy, no one makes a corn dog like you.
Jeremy: Oh, hi, Candace. Nice binoculars.
Candace: (Chuckling nervously) Yep. Yep, they definitely are working. I--I just bought these for my dad and was just...uh, you know, making sure that they work, and they sure do. You can see really far away or really up close. (Notices poster on counter) "Help wanted"?
Jeremy: Yeah! You should apply. We could work together.
Candace: You mean side by side?
Wendy: Hi, there. I'm really really motivated! Really really positive! Really really high-energy! And would like to apply for the job.
Candace: Excuse me, I'd also like to apply for the job.
Manager: Ladies, I'm afraid I only have one opening. How about a competition to see who gets the job?
Wendy: Sounds like a great idea to me. (At Candace) Good luck. (Extends hand; quickly takes it away) Ooh, too slow. I think I'll call you Molasses.
Candace: Molasses. Well, I think I'll call you something...slower than molasses, that's for sure.
(The manager and Jeremy stares at Candace)
Candace: This isn't part of the competition, is it?
(Scene switches to Doofenshmirtz driving a truck into the parking garage... with Perry following him on a jet pack.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, Perry the Platypus, welcome to my truck of doom. (Stops truck; Pushes a button)
(Perry gets trapped in a car seat)
Doofenshmirtz: I suppose you're wondering why I'm wearing lederhosen. (Pauses; Perry glares at him) What? I've the legs for it! (Stretches right leg on dashboard) Eh? Eh? Eh? (Lowers right leg) Anyway, it will all become clear soon enough!
Woman: (Growling, low-voice) Come on, Hansel! Move it!
(Honking)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, wise guy, I'm just explaining... Oh! (Chuckling) Sorry, madam. Sorry. (To Perry) Her voice was so masculine and growly. I thought it was a man.
(A woman appears with a scowl on her face.)
Doofenshmirtz: I mean, people must call her "sir" all the time on the phone. It must be so em... (Laughs) She's standing right behind me now, isn't she?
(The woman raises a fist; the screen goes black; she punches Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: Not one word, Perry the Platypus.
(Scene switches to a close-up view of the Googolplex Mall sign...)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, great! A line! (At a boy) Oh, brother! What is this, a model of Pluto? (Laughs) That planet doesn't even exist anymore, you moron!
Male teen: Thanks for holding my spot in line, little brother. (To Doofenshmirtz) What were you saying about Pluto?
Doofenshmirtz: Nothing. I'm sure it's...
(The screen goes black again)
Doofenshmirtz: (Groans; pulls model of Pluto off his head) I suppose you are wondering why I am putting myself through all of this.
(Flashback)
(Voice over) When I was young, I entered a science fair with my very first Inator. I-- I wasn't very clever with names yet. It was just, you know, Inator. Just as I was about to demonstrate my invention to the judges, a kid with a baking soda volcano stole the show! The next year, I tried again with my even bigger Inator. And again, my thunder was stolen by a baking soda volcano! I had enough of science. I decided to devote my life to poetry instead.
Young Adult Doofenshmirtz: The movies are gray, the TV is black, the horses are running, please bring me some food.
Doofenshmirtz: (Voice over) Yet, curiously, I still lost to a baking soda volcano!
(Flashback ends)
But never again! Behold! (Removes tarp) The world's largest baking soda volcano! I mean, it's got to be the biggest one here, right? It's gonna win. (Pauses) I feel confident.
Elderly man: Next?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, we're next.
Elderly man: Aren't you a little old to be entering this science fair?
Doofenshmirtz: No! What makes you say that? I mean, look at me! I'm wearing lederhosen!
Elderly man: (Pauses) Okay. Go ahead.
Doofenshmirtz: (Chuckles; to Perry) See? I know what I'm doing.
(Perry glares)
(Scene switches to Mr. McGillicuddy, Baljeet, Phineas, and Ferb standing in front of the portal)
Baljeet: (Cheerfully) Hi, Mr. McGillicuddy.
Mr. McGillicuddy: Well, I see you've built yourself a prototype, but the question still remains: Does...it...work?
Baljeet: Well, I think...
Phineas: Of course it works! Baljeet, fire it up.
(Baljeet pulls a lever, activating the portal.)
Mr. McGillicuddy: Ok, so I see science fair.
Baljeet: Take a closer look, Mr. McGillicuddy.
Mr. McGillicuddy: Wow! A science fair on Mars! Baljeet, you have just validated my entire career as an educator! You get an A+++! (Voice squeaks) I'm gonna go get the judges!
(Scene switches to Doofenshmirtz standing by the world's largest baking soda volcano)
Doofenshmirtz: Soon I will show them the havoc created when an acid and a base combine! (Laughs; dramatic music) But first I have to find an outlet 'cause there's a nice laser show that goes along with it. We'll take this out and put mine in. (Chuckles) Hello!
Mr. McGillicuddy: It's right over here. (At Baljeet) Baljeet, show our judges what Mr. McGillicuddy has taught you.
(Baljeet tries to turn the portal on)
Mr. McGillicuddy: Ah, um, just a moment. It takes the skilled hand of a master professor. (Chuckles) Hello! Mr. Martian! It's Mr. McGillicuddy. (Chuckles) Uno momento.
Judge #1: Who's up for corn dogs?
Judge #2: I am.
Mr. McGillicuddy: A-ha! Turn it all the way up to high. (Switches dial from "low" to "high") Yes! That should do it.
Phineas: I wonder what's wrong with the portal?
Baljeet: Ah, no matter. Personally, I never cared about winning. I just wanted a good grade.
Phineas: Aah. Well, who's up for corn dogs?
Baljeet: Me!
(Scene switches to Candace, the manager, and Wendy...)
Manager: Girls, your first task is to dress these dogs with ketchup and mustard. I'll be back in a bit to check your work. Good luck!
(Western movie music plays)
Wendy: (Growls)
Candace: (Holds up a bottle of ketchup) Hey, no fair! I ran out of ketchup. (Squeezes the bottle, then grins sheepishly.) Oops. Now I'm out of ketchup.
Wendy: (Squeezes a bottle of mustard) Oops. Now I'm out of mustard.
Candace: (Squeezes a bottle of relish twice) Oh, look, I'm out of relish!
(Wendy flattens a bottle of mayo on a cooking sheet)
Wendy: (Laughing)
(Candace throws two pickles, which lands on Wendy's eyes)
(Scene switches to Mr. McGillicuddy, who's still trying to get the portal to work)
Mr. McGillicuddy: It's gotta work, it's gotta...work! Huh? (notices the plug to the portal)
(Scene switches to Perry, who got out of the car seat trap by ripping the lower half of his fur off)
(Perry reaches around inside his boxers and pulls out a small device)
(Beeps)
(Perry runs off)
Doofenshmirtz: Now just add some vinegar and... (Perry lands on his head; he screams)
Mr. McGillicuddy: It just wasn't plugged in. There's an outlet over there. (Notices a high voltage outlet; plugs the cord in, cackling) It's working! It's working!
Doofenshmirtz: Ew, gross! I smell like...salad. (Mumbling; slips on vinegar; lands in the volcano, which then "erupts") Say goodbye to this pair of lederhosen. Hey, I'm unhurt! Yes, I am invincible! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Where am I going?
Judge #1: All right, so what was it you wanted to show us?
Mr. McGillicuddy: (Stuttering) No! It was here!
Judge #1: Come on, let's go find a real winner.
Mr. McGillicuddy: But... But... But...
Girl: Excuse me, am I too late to enter?
Judge #1: Are those mechanical arms?
Girl: Why, yes. I used them to make this baking soda volcano.
Judge #1: (Gasps) A baking soda volcano? Cool! 1st prize!
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, come on!
Mr. McGillicuddy: But... (Back in the kitchen...)
Manager: Well, seeing as you've used most of my ketchup and mustard to dress yourselves, I'm afraid neither of you get the job.
Candace: Snail! I'll call you you Snail. Ha!
Wendy: You're quick. (In the mall...)
Isabella: I just can't believe you built a portal to Mars and didn't go through it yourselves!

Buford: (Sobbing)
Phineas: The crying? Hey, what's wrong, Buford? Why are you crying?
Buford: First, let's get one thing straight: I'm not crying. I'm just sweating through my eyes. And second...I lost Biff! (Sobbing)
Phineas: You mean your goldfish?
Buford: Yes! (Sobbing) He changed my life, you know. I used to be a wimp, just like you. But then, one day, at the carnival, I was somehow drawn to this game.
Young Buford: (Hammers, Ding)
Buford: And that's how I won my goldfish. I named it Biff, after my mother. It was the happiest day of my life. But then I met the local bully.
Bully: Hello, nerd! Well, well, what do we have here? Looks like you brought me lunch! (Puts Biff over his mouth) (Laughs)
Buford: I knew I had to defend my friend, so I did what I had to do.
(Punches landing)
After that, I became the bully. And I wasn't afraid of anything or anybody. Except, you know, maybe a giant squid, cause-- Come on, those are freaky, right? All suction cuppy and beaky. (Waves splashing) But then, today...Biff and I decided to go for a swim. After a while, I couldn't hear him anymore. I got worried.
Flashback Buford: No! NO!!
(Flashback ends)
Buford: (Sobbing hysterically)
Phineas: Wow. This was more annoying than when he was bullying us. We gotta do something to get the old Buford back. Maybe we should help him find his fish.
Buford: Really? You guys would do that? How about a hug?
Phineas: Maybe later.
Buford: Let Buford hug you.
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?
Buford: Come here!

Major Monogram: Morning, Agent P. We've intercepted some very surprising footage from a local TV station. (Plays video)
Reporter: Breaking news: A kitten in peril! Up a tree! (Cat falls) Oh no!

Wow, a good Samaritan saved her!
Major Monogram: (Stops video) You see that? Dr. Doofenshmirtz saving a kitten. Looks like he's defecting to the good side! Make contact and present him with our standard welcome package. Monogram out.

Stacy: Hey, Candace, look, is that a submarine? (Helicopter whirring) And aren't those your brothers?
Phineas: I can't believe how fast we put this together.
Ferb: Yes. Usually takes us at least a montage.

Repairman: Better enjoy it while you can, boys. These old fellows are pretty worn out. I'll be back in a little while to haul them away. 
Phineas: What a shame. I wonder if they're still as much fun as they used to be. 
(In a flashback, Phineas and Ferb ride the spaceship rides, defeating a giant robot. Unfortunately, the ride in reality is pretty underwhelming, with its only action being shaking back and forth. Phineas is not amused.)

I'm tapping into their ozone-depleting propellants to fuel my latest evil scheme: The Aerosol-Propelled Ozone-Deplete-Inator!

Phineas: Hang on, Candace! We're right behind you! Good thing we tricked out the other rides. Come on! (Phineas and the gang grab onto each of the rides and head out to save Candace)

Phineas: Nuts. Lost her in the skyline. Isabella, we need you to get us an aerial view. 
Isabella: Sure, Phineas. (she lifts her ride upward) Whee! 
(Candace blasts through a farm house, carrying tons of chickens) 
Farmer: Well, what do you know? Nostradamus was right. 
(The chickens get blown away from the ride, revealing a cow in their place, which soon gets blown as well and reveals Candace underneath it) 
Isabella: Wow, she just flew through a barn and her lips are still shiny! 
(Candace screams as she notices nearby buildings. She dodges them all in near perfection. Meanwhile, Baljeet's ride starts to come to a stop due to the expired ride time.) 
Baljeet: Oh, my friends. It appears that I am out of fuel. 
Phineas: No, Baljeet. (On radio) Just put in another quarter. 
Baljeet: But all I have is a dollar. (He notices that the machine takes bills) Oh. What do you know. (He straightens the dollar with his hands and inserts it into the slot. It spits it out. He tries again, but fails. He uses the ride's handle as a straightedge to ensure that the bill goes inside the slot. He tries several times to get the ride to take his dollar, but the machine won't. Eventually, the slot starts to properly read the bill.) Hm. (The dollar has spat out again) Oh, come on. (He tries several more times, all to no avail) 
(Cut back to D.E. Inc) 
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, water. It's like drinking wet air. Now, Perry the Platypus, sit back and listen as the entire Tri-State Area screams the name Heinz Doofenshmirtz and never forgets it again! (Two aerosol cans fall into Perry's trap, and he uses them like a jetpack to propel his way out) Hold it right there, Perry the Platypus. (Doofenshmirtz tries to crush Perry with his giant mechanical hand, but Perry dodge it) Agh! 
(At the Danville Canyon, Candace is still screaming, but her engine begins sputtering and the rocket loses power, sending her falling) 
Candace: Uh-oh. (She screams) Phineas, help, I'm falling! 
Phineas: Just put in another quarter. 
Candace: (as she checks her handbag for change) I don't have another quarter! (continues screaming) 
(Ferb notices some tourists and gets an idea. He uses a boombox and monochrome clothing so he can do a short dance and earn a coin from them.) 
(Song: "Phinedroids and Ferbots" Instrumental) 
(Ferb dances to the music in a robotic fashion. The tourists gladly give Ferb a single quarter, which he shoots with a slingshot into Candace's rocket, giving it back its power. It propels back to town) 
(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz) 
Doofenshmirtz: (He laughs) Hey, nice move, Perry the Platypus, I got to "hand" it to you. Here, let me give you a "hand." Hey, hey. I'm gonna crush you with my big mechanical "hand." Ha! Well, I– I guess that one was just literal, but I've got you now. (Candace bursts through Doofenshmirtz's lair, cutting off the giant hand) Wow. Nostradamus was right! (Perry uses the giant hand to smack Doofenshmirtz into the trap he was previously in) Ow! You know, I don't come to your house and– Wait, these don't have any chlorofluorocarbons in them at all. These aerosol cans are completely harmless! Wh-what was I thinking!? Curse you, Perry the Platypus! 
(Cut back to Candace, where Isabella uses a lasso to catch her) 
Isabella: Okay, I got her. Yee-haw! 
(Isabella lassos Candace's ride, bringing it under control) 
Phineas: Good work, everybody. Let's bring it on back to the store. 
(They return to the store and the kiddie rides park.) 
Phineas: (At the store) (To Candace) Well, it looks like you made it back in one piece. 
Candace: You guys are gonna be so busted when I show Mom what you did to those kiddie rides! (leaves) 
(Perry chatters) 
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry. 
(Right on cue, a repairman takes the tricked out rocket away on a cart.) 
Repairman: All right, one side, kids. We're replacing these old rides with brand-new identical ones. (a new identical rocket is brought out) With special emphasis on the identical. (closes truck and leaves on it) See ya! 
Phineas: Bye, now! (to the kids) Well, that was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can supe up our old bikes. 
Buford: La-ame! 
Phineas: (as they leave) That's what you said about the kiddie rides. 
Buford: (offscreen) And I was right! Until I wasn't! 
(Candace arrives with Linda right on schedule, oblivious to the switch.) 
Candace: (Talking fast) Here it is, Mom, I'll show you! If you'll give me a quarter, please? (She sits in the ride.) 
Linda: Aren't you a little old for kiddie rides? 
Candace: No, no, I'm not! Check it out! 
(She puts the quarter in; the ride operates normally to her surprise; long pause.) 
Linda: (dryly) Well...I guess it does have rocking back-and-forth and slowness? 
(Back with Baljeet, who's using an iron to straighten out the dollar) 
Baljeet: (After ironing his dollar bill) Okay, dollar, this is your last chance. (He inserts the bill into the slot for a final time, successfully giving the machine credits. However, the ironing table goes off instead. Baljeet kicks ride in frustration, making the ride goes off. He looks at the camera, unamused) 

(Opens with Phineas and Ferb playing with a swingset they invented)
Phineas: Hi, Mom.
Linda: Hi, boys. What are you kids up to today?
Phineas: Just trying out our new invention. It's called the Ladybug 2000 Roving Swingset. Want a whirl?
Linda: (oblivious) Not right now, sweetie. I'm going to the gardening store. Something's been eating my hydrangeas.
(The hydrangeas are literally being sucked into the ground.) 
(They land outside the backyard, Isabella walks by holding a sign reading "Save the Starnose Mole")
Phineas: Hey, Isabella. (Seeing Ferb lands with the air bag) Good thing we installed an air bag. So, what'cha dooooin'?
Isabella: The Fireside Girls are trying to raise money to save the star-nose mole.
Phineas: And how's it going?
Isabella: (Sadly) Not very well. We started a bake sale... (cut to Holly, whose face and hair are all blown up, holding a burnt bag, Isabella continues off screen) ...then we tried cat-sitting... (pan to Ginger with scratch marks, torn clothes and a similar sign, cat hair falls from her) ...even a lemonade stand... (pan to Katie, body nearly wrapped in bandages) ...but, nothing worked.
Phineas: Now what's a good way to raise some money? (Epiphany) I got it! We construct a zip line from the top of Danville's tallest skyscraper all the way to our--
Isabella: (Interrupting Phineas) Or we could have a car wash!
Phineas: That's good too! We'll build the best dang car wash in the whole dang world, dang it. (To Ferb) I can't really pull that off, can I?
Ferb: You're not very street.
Phineas: (Sadly) Yeah. (Realizing) Hey, where's Perry? 
(Cut to Perry in backyard in front of a pile of dirt. He runs and dives into the pile, which leads to a series of tubes that eventually drop him onto his chair, which slides along a track to in front of the screen.)
Major Monogram: Way to stick that landing, Agent P. (Holds up a sign with 9.5 written on it.)
(Monogram moves aside and Carl joins him on screen, holding up an "8.5" sign.)
Major Monogram: (to Carl) Eight and a half, Carl? Really?
Carl: Well, sir, he did separate his feet a little on the reentry.
Major Monogram: Carl! Ugh! (Looking off screen) Hey is something burning over on the stove?
Carl: My spaghetti! (Runs off)
Major Monogram: (to Perry) Anywho, we've had some grave concerns. Seems there's been some extreme seismic activity in the area. We're pretty sure our old friend Doofenshmirtz is up to no good.
(Carl reenters, interrupting Monogram)
Carl: Excuse me sir. (Holding up booklet entitled "Seismic Activity and Quakes - by Carl") I wrote my sophomore thesis on quakes and seismic events. If you want you can check out my website.
Major Monogram: Ugh, Carl. Spaghetti.
Carl: Oh, that's right! (Drops booklet and runs off screen) 
(Cut to view of sky. A plane flies overhead. Cardboard boxes and animals, all with parachutes, fall from the plane and land in Phineas and Ferb's back yard. Cut to Phineas and Worker)
Worker: Hey, here's your delivery, kid. Friction rollers, spot-free rinser, individual driers, turbo spray nozzles, jet powered vacuum, atomic collider.
Phineas: I suppose you're going to ask me if I'm too young to use this stuff.
Worker: Nah, just try not to blow a hole through the earth's core, or we'll both be in deep doody.
Phineas: Okay. 
(Cut to Candace in her room, on the phone. Construction can be seen through the window in the background.)
Candace: Stacy, I sent Jeremy a text message twelve minutes ago and he still hasn't answered. You don't think I'm making a big deal out of this?
Stacy: No way.
Candace: What am I going to do, Stacy?
Stacy: You've got to play hard to get.
Candace: Hard to get?
Stacy: Jeremy thinks you'll go with him anywhere, anytime, just for the asking. Don't be a lapdog, Candace. Just say no!
(Candace's phone beeps and she looks at it.)
Candace: Uh-oh, Stacy. That's Jeremy. (Presses button on phone to talk to Jeremy) Hello?
Jeremy: Hey, Candace. I'm taking my mom's car to this crazy new car wash. Would you like to go for a ride?
Candace: A car? That is so grown up. I mean, hold please? (Presses button on phone to talk to Stacy.) Stacy, Jeremy is asking me out for a ride, in a car!
Stacy: Wow, that's so grown up! But you gotta be strong. Remember, hard to get.
Candace: Right, hard to get. I'll call you back. (Presses button on phone to talk to Jeremy.) Umm, about the car and the ride, I would love to (Candace screams. Jeremy holds the phone away from his ear as the force of Candace's scream makes his hair blow back.) Wait, I mean, I better check my schedule. (Covers phone and hums victory music to herself). You're in luck. I can just squeeze you in. 
Jeremy: Great. Pick you up later.
Candace: (Puts down phone.) Ahh, Jeremy. (Presses button on phone to talk to Stacy.) Stacy, I am like so hard to get right now. It's like totally-- (Notices the construction outside her window.) Wait, what in the... Gotta go, Stacy. 
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb in back yard. Ferb is holding the switch for a cannon-like machine.)
Phineas: Alright, Ferb. Let's test out the turbo-charged uber-nozzle.
Candace: (From her window.) What the heck is going-- (Gets cut off mid sentence as she is sprayed by water from the turbo-charged uber-nozzle.)
Phineas: It works! 
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated ♪
(Perry walks by "Anti-Platypus Security" sign, runs down a hallway consisting of a series of dangerous traps: spiked doors, laser beams, fish, swinging blades. He opens an air vent and drops into Doofenshmirtz's apartment.)
Doofenshmirtz: Well, it looks like that anti-platypus security system was a total waste of money. I am so taking that back.
(Perry gets caught in a rope hanging from a fake palm tree and ends up dangling by his feet.)
Doofenshmirtz: Thank goodness for old reliable traps, huh? I'm so glad you're going to hang around. (Laughs) Anyway, you arrived just in time to witness the unveiling of my latest invention. Let me introduce to you the Mountain-out-of-a-Molehill-inator. All my life, I was told, (Begin a series of flashbacks) "Don't make a mountain out of a molehill," "Don't make a mountain out of a molehill," "Don't make a mountain out of a molehill." Well now I intend to do just that. This machine will infuse electricity into a small little sphere of compressed nitrogen molecules, which I will then drop into the earth and it will make all the tiny little molehill molecules grow and grow into enormous mo-- (Stops mid-sentence) You know, it's kind of complicated. I learned about it on some kid's website. (Shows computer monitor with Carl's website on the screen.) Oh, oh, and you know what else I found on the web? It's these pictures of cats and they write these—oh, l-l-l-look at this one, "Invisible Cheeseburger". (Perry, still upside-down, looks unimpressed.) No, huh? Well, it's not for everyone, I just think they're funny. Anyway, so I take the sphere, electrify it, drop it in the ground, ta-da! Mountains! Out of molehills! (Perry unimpressed) I know when people say that, they usually mean it figuratively, it's an analogy, bu-bu-but making a point, I can do whatever I want. 
(Cut to Baljeet and Buford in mole suits holding signs in front of Phineas and Ferb's house. Baljeet's sign says "Save the Mole" and Buford's says "Wash your Car")
Baljeet: I will be honest. I think we look ridiculous.
Buford: Are you kiddin'? (Flips his sign, stands on his hands, and holds it with his feet.) I make this look good. 
(Cut to the backyard, where a very extravagant car wash now stands.)
Phineas: Okay, Ferb, let's fire this add it up!
(Ferb pulls a lever activating the car wash. We hear B-52's-esque new wave music in the background.)

Candace: (Candace and Linda's Sandcastle falls over) Err! This is the third time it's fallen! I used to be good at this! Now I'm Frank Lloyd Wrong! When did it get so hard?
Girl: (Standing next to her sandcastle) Oh man, this is super simple!
Candace: Argh, I hate this stupid contest. I quit!
Linda: Hon, will you relax? This is supposed to be fun.
Jeremy: Hey, Candace! Hey, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher!
Candace: Jeremy?! Hi! (She stutters) What brings you to the magnificent shores of Danville?
Jeremy: Well, I'm the judge of the contest this year.
Candace: No way!
Jeremy: Way! I'm excited to see what you two come up with! But you better get started, time's tickin'!
Candace: Mom? Why are you just standing there? Sand castles don't build themselves. Chop chop! 
Doofenshmirtz: You see, Perry the Platypus? Your efforts to try to stop me have been fruitless. Fruitless. Y-you like that one? Yeah, that's a good one! Fruitless? Next time you'll "leaf" me alone! Heh heh heh. Yes, Perry the Platypus, I can be a fun guy. Get it? Fungi? The plural of fungus? Heheh... it's a... Yeah... Anyway, grow my green minions and get him! (He turns on a machine, and sprays the plants, making them thorny, carnivorous, and sentient) Wait, wait not me, not me... Hey, wait, don't be, don't be grab... I gotta turn this off... this has become a thorny situation...
(The plants soon ensnare Doofenshmirtz, and overrun the entire blimp) 
Delivery Man: Four weather balloons and helium canisters, for underwater delivery...
Phineas: That's us!
Delivery Man: Aren't you kids a little young to be discovering Atlantis?
Phineas: Yes, yes we are.
Deliver Man: Well, good for you.
Phineas: Alright guys, let's get to work! 
(Candace and Linda frantically work on the sandcastle)
Candace: Oh no, Jeremy is almost here! 
Doofenshmirtz: Help, Perry the Platypus, help! (The plants squeeze Perry out of his trap) Yes, yes, Perry, you got it! That's it, you're free now, and move over here... wait! Where are you going? Perry the Platyp... (Doofenshmirtz gets slapped by a vine) 
Phineas: Okay guys, tie the balloons to the four corners of Atlantis. Looks good, Ferb!
(The balloons inflate, and Atlantis rise up)
All: Wohooo! It's working! 
(On the beach)
Jeremy: (Judging a sandcastle) Lookin' good, guys!
Candace: (To Linda) Looks kinda...
Linda: ...cool!
Candace: (A piece of their sandcastle falls off) This is horrible! Jeremy's gonna take one look at this, and think that I'm a big losery loser!
Linda: Oh, honey, Jeremy's smart enough to separate your sandcastle from his feelings about you!
Jeremy: Okay, now last, but not least, we have the Flynn-Fletchers...
(Atlantis rises up behind Candace and Linda)
Candace: Well, it's not perfect but... we had fun doing it, so, I give you, our sandcastle.
Jeremy: (looking up, and seeing Atlantis) Holy Moly, Candace!
Candace: I know, I know, it's not great, but we did our best.
Jeremy: Are you kidding? It's amazing! You win, you win! I'm gaining to get your blue ribbon.
Candace: Huh? 
Doofenshmirtz: (A vine chomps down on Doofenshmirtz's nose) AHH!
(Perry comes in through the window, with weed-whackers, and proceeds to cut through the plants) 
(A few of the thorny plant vines pop the balloons holding up Atlantis, letting Atlantis sink again)
Linda: I have to say, I think Jeremy can't separate his feelings for you from his feelings for this sand castle. He must like you more than you thought...
Candace: Hehe. I know! Let's go get that blue ribbon! 
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus, you came back and saved me! Thank you, Perry the Platy... (He begins to breakout) Hey... wha... what's this? I'm having an allergic reaction to these stupid plants! Curse you, inadequate immune system! 
Baljeet: What happened?
Isabella: Did anybody see it?
Buford: Why did it go back down?
Ferb: Perhaps the lost city of Atlantis wanted to stay lost.
Irving: At least I got the pictures in my head. Hey! I had my thumb in front of the lens the whole time! Oh, now all I remember is my thumb!

Announcer: Flawless Girl. Because nobody's perfect without using our cosmetics.
Candace: (Scoffs) I'd be so lost without Flawless Girl giving me some pointers on how to look.
Stacy: Hey, look! (Flips the magazine) It says here that Flawless Girl founder, Blanca Dishon, will be at the Mid-Summer's Festival in search of the next Flawless Girl spokes-model.
Candace: Maybe I should sign up.
(Laughs) Just out of curiosity, when is the Mid-Summer's Festival?
Stacy: Probably in the middle of summer... which is about now!

(Scene cut to the street by the house, where Mid-Summer's Festival trucks drive by and then to Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher watching them)
Phineas: Oh, what do you know, it must be the middle of summer.
(Beeping sound) It's the Baljeet Signal!
(He and Ferb duck, and Baljeet's hologram appears on Phineas' device)
Baljeet: Phineas and Ferb, days ago, you helped me build a portal to Mars.
Now, I beg you to help me win the Biggest Watermelon Contest at the festival. Help me, Phineas and Ferb. You're my only hope! (Looks around and then shuts off his hologram)
Phineas: Ferb, grab that Jr. Chemistry Set you got for Bastille Day. We're going to the festival.
Hey, where's Perry?

(Scene cut to Agent P, who landed on his lair's chair with a lot of water and koi)
Major Monogram: Oh, for crying out loud! Who put a secret entrance at the bottom of the neighbors' koi pond? Okay, look-look-look. To avoid a lawsuit, give the fish hats, and we'll make them agents, and uh... Ooh, right!
Agent P, your mission. Um you, know, Doofenshmirtz! Go!

♪ (Perry)! ♪

(At the festival)
Phineas: Hey Baljeet, where's your watermelon?
Baljeet: Yeah, look at it! (He reveals a small watermelon) It mocks me, bringing shame to my family.
Phineas: Ferb, time for a little chemistry.
(Ferb walks over to an empty spot, opens his Jr. Chemistry Set and reveals a large chemistry work area)
Baljeet: Hmm. Could I borrow Ferb sometime?

(Elsewhere, Candace is walking through the festival)
Candace: Flawless Girl booth...where is it?
P. P. Otter: Hey you, girl! Don't you ever look in the mirror and end up feeling bad about yourself?
Candace: Well...
P. P. Otter: For just five dollars, you can feel good about yourself for no time!
Candace: Oh, I don't need that. I've got Flawless Girl cosmetics to make me feel good.
(Walks through the festival and sees Phineas and Ferb, who are using the chemistry set)
Phineas: ...And bada bing bada boom, you've got your miracle growth elixir.
Candace: What are you guys up to?
Phineas: Hey Candace! We're gonna help Baljeet with the Biggest Watermelon Contest.
Candace: (Pointing to the watermelon) What's that, a cantaloupe?
Baljeet: (Giving himself a facepalm) Aww!
Phineas: Not for long.
(Puts a drop of the growth elixir on the watermelon, and it hardly grows larger)
Candace: (Laughs) It worked! Your miracle growth elixir has turned you into giant nerds! (Walks away)
Baljeet: I will call my family and tell them to start putting up the shame curtains.
Phineas: No way! It hasn't taken full effect yet. You'll see.
Baljeet: Not through the shame curtains, I won't.

(At the Flawless Girl booth)
Blanca: Next!
Candace: You're Blanca Dishon! I'm Candace. I'm here to become your next Flawless Girl.
Blanca: Stand over by that sign, please. (Candace walks over to the sign and is too short, two inches away from the expected height.) Hmm. Aren't you a little short to be the next Flawless Girl?
Candace: Uh...
Blanca: Yes. Yes you are.
Candace: But I'm five-foot-eight!
Blanca: (Sigh) Look, it's right in our song:
"At the forefront of every trend.
Never less than five-foot-ten."
Candace: I thought you were just looking for a rhyme.
Blanca: Nobody is perfect. But you can come close by buying our full line of Flawless Girl skin care products.
Next!

(Later, Candace, walking around with Flawless Girl cosmetics, is on her phone with Linda)
Candace: (Sobs to Mom via phone) So I can never be perfect! No matter what I do, I'll always be two inches too ugly! I need a sudden growth spurt in the next fifteen minutes.
Linda: Oh, honey, it's not bad-
Candace: (Gasp) I got it! Thanks, Mom!
Linda: Uh, you're welcome!

(Cut to Phineas, Ferb, and Baljeet with the chemistry set)
Baljeet: All this waiting is maddening. Maybe we should put some more growth elixir on it?
Phineas: Actually, it only works once. Putting more on it won't make it grow anymore.
(Candace secretly steals the growth elixir) But be patient. It's not done yet.
Candace: (Laughs and pours the growth elixir on herself to grow two inches) Yes, it worked! I feel great! If that, I feel flawless!

(Back at the Flawless Girl booth)
Blanca: It's amazing! Your height is now perfect! You're now in the running to become the next Flawless Girl.

(Cut to Phineas, Ferb, and Baljeet)
Baljeet: So... are there Fireside Boys, too?
(The watermelon starts to grow to an enormous size)
Phineas: Run!
(The watermelon destroys the chemistry set)
Baljeet: I am going to need a crane! ...And a new pair of pants.

(Candace and Stacy meet)
Stacy: There you are! So what happened?
Candace: I'm in! Auditions start in two hours! (giggles)
Stacy: Hey, is there something different about you?
Candace: Who knows? Maybe I've grown out of my awkward phase.
(Suddenly, her nose begins to grow)
Stacy: Looks like you're growing into another one.
Candace: Oh, no! I have to find a mirror!
(She zips out of the frame and goes into the House of Mirrors.)

(Inside the House of Mirrors. We see Candace's reflection, which seems to be normal.)
Candace: Oh thank goodness! I look totally normal. Oof!
Stacy: (Comes in with her reflection looking like she has a small head and a large body.) Are you okay, Candace?
Candace: Wait a second. If you look like that, wha-wha-wha—
(cut to reveal Candace's head, which is now more than twice its original size) I've turned into Bobblehead Candace!!!
(runs out) AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

(P.P. Otter is on the phone with someone)
P.P. Otter: No one will forego the five dollars to see my pathetic oddballs anymore. I gotta find some new talent fast.
(Candace, finding a place to hide, goes inside a tent while now wagging her now-giant tongue)
P.P. Otter: I'm gonna have to call you back, Nana.

(Bobblehead Candace is hiding inside a tent)
Candace: Phineas and Ferb. (gasps) They did this to me, they can undo it. (her body finally grows to the size of her head) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
(Cut to outside the tent. Candace tries to sneak away. She pops her head out once to see if the coast is clear before continuing to sneak out.)

(Cut to Phineas and Ferb.)
Candace: (offscreen) Psst, Phineas.
Phineas: Yes, strange talking tent?
Candace: No, it's me, Candace.
Phineas: That's what happened to the growth elixir.
Candace: Please tell me you have some sort of shrinking antidote.
Phineas: No, but don't worry. We'll get right on it.
Candace: Someone's coming! (she sticks her head back into the tent)
P.P. Otter: Hello, boys. The name's P.P. Otter. I run the Oddball Show.
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend in the tent?
Phineas: Oh, that's our sister. Our... (stifles laughter) big sister.
(He and Ferb try to hold their laughter in while Candace growls) Okay, sorry.
Candace, this is P.P. (Ferb giggles)
Candace: Yeah, we've met.
P.P. Otter: (taking out a business card) How would you like to make me rich beyond your wildest dreams?
Candace: Sorry, I'm kinda going through something at the moment.
P.P. Otter: Well, if ya change your mind, give me a call. (he leaves)
Candace: Okay, guys, you gotta change me back!
The Flawless Girl auditions are in a couple of hours!

♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated ♪
Doofenshmirtz: What the?! Oh, the festival's so loud I can't even hear my own evil jingle!
(turns around) Okay, guys, (cut to reveal four singers in a recording booth) take it from the top, louder!
Singer 1: A-one, two...
The Slacks: ♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incor— ♪
(The jingle is interrupted by Perry who lands on a drumset.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, what now?! (Perry dizzily emerges from behind the drums, playing a banjo off-key) A banjo-playing platypus? (Perry puts on his fedora) Perry the Banjo-Playing Platypus?!?! Uh, take five, guys. Not you, Perry the Platypus, i—if I can just have a word with you. (Perry walks into the engineer's station, where he immediately gets trapped) Ha ha ha! (the trapping device raises up to reveal Perry trapped in a baby carrier)
It's a cute little trap, isn't it? I got the idea at my cousin Gertrude's baby shower. (Perry gives him a look)
Well, don't judge me, men go to baby showers these days! It was fun. Presents, blindfolded diapering... I'm sorry, I-I'm off-topic, aren't I? It's this darn midsummer's festival! With the laughing and the music and the constant ringing on my bell to use the bathroom! (toilet flushes in the background) Well, I'm going to put an end it once and for all! You see, I have created a device to cover the entire midsummer's festival with the worst smell in the history of mankind! Dirty diapers! (Perry gives off a look of disgust and terror) And, yeah, I got all that from a baby shower. How do you like me now, Perry the Judge-ya-pus?

(Cut to Giant Candace, Phineas, and Ferb)
Candace: Can't you you just make up some kind of reducing cream? Or an amazing shrink ray device?
Phineas: Well, we'll see what we can do, but we're not magicians.
Candace: (sighs) I'm a freak! (cries) I'll never be a Flawless Girl! (Ferb takes out an umbrella to cover himself and his stepbrother from Candace's rain-like tears) There's only one place where a girl like me will fit in! The Oddball Show! It was nice knowing you boys! Tell Mom and Dad I love 'em! From now on, I'll be living amongst the carnies!
(sobs and stomps away)
(Phineas gives Ferb a look of concern.)
P.P. Otter: Excellent! Now all we need is a big promotional stunt! Here's what I got in mind: in a reversal of a familiar theme, you can climb a skyscraper carrying me dressed in this gorilla suit. (Tears away his suit revealing a gorilla costume underneath)
Candace: Um... okay... How long have you been wearing that?
P.P. Otter: All day!

(At D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: So, Perry the Platypus, (Candace is seen out the window climbing up) I found a way to distill the smell of dirty diapers into a concentrated liquid form, (He shows Perry a beaker filled with blue liquid.) which I will spread throughout the festival using my Smellinator!

(Pan up to the top of the building. Giant Candace is now on top holding Otter in the gorilla suit.)

(At the Flawless Girl tent at the festival, Blanca is holding a crown standing next to two girls.)
Blanca: And ze next Flawless Girl is... (she looks up as the two girls gasp, cut to Candace, then cut back to Blanca) Oh, zat is ze most Flawless Girl I have ever seen!

Candace: Is all this really necessary?
P.P. Otter: C'mon, kid, you can't back out now!
(Blanca appears on the balcony)
Blanca: (appears on the balcony) Candace, I've got some great news!
Candace: I can't hear you! Oh, hold on!
(She holds out her giant palm to invite Blanca onto it and raises both her and Otter)
Blanca: I said, "I've got some great news!!" You are ze next Flawless Girl! Wiz your height, girls will never be able to live up to the expectations you'll set! They'll be forced to buy my product forever!
P.P. Otter: Scram! She's my oddball!
Blanca: No! My Flawless Girl!
P.P. Otter: She's a freak!
Blanca: She's "freak"-ishly beautiful!
Candace: Wait a second! I just realized something! You both make money off of people's natural insecurities.
(to Otter) You show people oddballs so they'll feel better about themselves, (to Blanca) and you make beauty totally unobtainable so they'll feel worse about themselves! Look at me! I'm fifty feet tall now and it's still out of reach! Well, I've had it! Making beauty the focus of my life has distracted me from the real focus of my life: Busting my brothers. Giant Candace is out, PEACE!
(She jumps off the building and lands on the ground with a thud)
P.P. Otter: (seeing a beaker behind him) Growth elixir? So this is what she used!
Blanca: (grabbing it) Let me see zat!
P.P. Otter: It's my growth elixir!
Blanca: No, it's mine!
P.P. Otter: Mine!
Blanca: Mine!
(The beaker falls out of both of their hands and falls)

(Cut to Perry and Doofenshmirtz)

Doofenshmirtz: Now watch as the smell of dirty diapers
(the growth elixir lands in his hand)
pollutes the very molecules that surround this building!
I just snap it into place and set the range for, say, 200 yards around the building.
(Perry struggles to get out of his trap)
Hear that, Perry the Platypus? That is the sound of smell! Nothing can stop me now!
(Some water pouring on him contradicts his statement. When the water stops, it is revealed that some aquatic agents have arrived. One of the fish untraps Perry, who kicks Doofenshmirtz onto the range selector.)
Uh-oh. The whole universe? Not good.
(The Smellinator activates spreading the growth elixir throughout the whole universe. Wide shot of the Earth. Zoom out revealing the entire solar system. First the planets begins to grow. Then the Earth and the Moon grow.)

(In the street, giant Candace is running back home to tell Linda, oblivious to the growing city under her.)
Candace: Mom! Mom!
(Scene shifts to inside the house where Linda is washing the dishes)
Look what Phineas and Ferb did to me. I'm fifty feet tall. I don't even fit in.... the... house. (realizing) I'm back to normal.
Linda: "Normal" being a relative term.

(Back at D.E.I. with Doofenshmirtz and Perry and one of the fish agents)
Doofenshmirtz: (sniffing) Well, doesn't smell any different. I wonder what went wrong. (Perry kicks Doofenshmitz who lands on the table carrying the dirty diaper smell beaker, which he catches) Oh, here's my stinky poo-poo stuff! I thought I put this in the Smellinator. (Perry kicks him again, throwing the formula away) NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! (Perry puts all the fish agents in a plastic bag and makes his escape)
♪ Agent P! ♪
(The smell surrounds the entire building)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, no! (coughs) That is.... What was I thinking?

(Back at the festival with Phineas, Ferb, and Baljeet)
Phineas: So didja win the giant watermelon contest?
Baljeet: I was about to
(showing the now tiny watermelon) when this happened!
Phineas: So the watermelon shrank?
Ferb: Well, either that or everything else in the universe just got bigger.
Baljeet: C'est la vie. Shame curtains are not going to hang themselves.

Phineas: There's our new pet Goldie. I wonder if we're as cute to her as she is to us? (Pause) Yeah, yeah we are. What can we do for Goldie since she's already done so much for us?
(The boys thinks when Ferb gets an idea and pulls out a blueprint)
Phineas: A marine-life aquarium? Great idea, Ferb! Let's build a best ever of one of these and give Goldie that special home she deserves. Does that sound good to you, Perry?
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: (At Goldie) So it's unanimous. Hey, where's Candace? 
(Scene cut to the kitchen)
Linda: Candace? Where are you? (Notices Candace) What are you doing?
Candace: Waiting for Jeremy to call! You see, last night, at the movies, he said was going to call soon. So I calculated that "soon" must mean first thing in the morning since "soon" can't refer to a period in excess of or equal to 24 hours, give or take a 59-minute cushion of time, on either side of the event in question. (Candace holds up a notepad of her math) See? I had it all figured out right here on this notepad. I even showed my math!
Linda: Uh...
Candace: Wait! Maybe I should have carried the one instead of dividing by Jeremy's face...
Linda: Well, I'm off to my favorite author's book signing. Try not to freak out on your brothers while I'm gone.
Candace: Mom! I don't frea—Oh my gosh! The square root of "soon" is "never"!

Boat captain: Say, aren't you boys a little young to man a fishing vessel?
Phineas: Why, yes. Yes we are.
Boat captain: Well, alright then.
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?

Major Monogram: Oh, Agent P, uh, pardon the newspapers, but, uh, we have a lot of new young recruits coming through here today, and, well, they aren't, uh, trained yet. Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has recently purchased the Tri-State Area's entire supply of bratwurst. Get to the bottom of it. Oh, and, uh, watch your step on the way out. 
(Scene shifts back to the backyard aquarium, where more fish are surrounding Goldie.)
Phineas: Goldie, how do you like your new friends?
(An orca eats Goldie.)
Phineas: NOOOOOOOOO!
(The orca sprays Goldie out of its blowhole, Ferb catches her and puts her back in the water.)
Phineas: That was cool enough to be in one of those trained marine animal shows. Hmm...Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today.

(Ferb looks at his notepad and simply shrugs. Cut back to Candace where she is being twirled around and around by the orca while being held by the octopus.)
Candace: Must...take...picture! (She snaps a pic.) Send! 
(Cut to the bookstore, where there is a long line. We hear the muzak version of "Gitchee Gitchee Goo" over the speakers. Pan across to the front of the line where Linda is getting a book signed. The book is You & Your High-Strung Teen.)
Linda: I've gotta tell you, I read your first book and I love it.
Bridgette Oshinomi: Do you have a high-strung teen at home?
Linda: Uh, you could say that. (her phone beeps) Ooh, this must be her.
Bridgette Oshinomi: She sent you a picture? Lemme see.
Linda: Well...okay.
Bridgette Oshinomi: How bad can it be? After all, I've been through with own— (She sees the picture of Candace freaking out) Oh. (gives the phone back to Linda) I think that maybe you need the rest of the set. (gives two books) Uh, and why don't you take a whack at that first book again? 
(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz and Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: And now, Perry the Platypus, (activating his inator) it is time for revenge! Goodbye, hot dog street ven— (Perry pushes Doof to the ground.) Oh, what the?! How did you get out of my trap? (Cut to reveal a wooden Perry in the trap with a tag saying "DECOY" on it.) A decoy? That doesn't even make any sense! But, okay, I surrender, I'm a reasonable man. (reaching around) I know when it's time to (grabs a bratwurst and whacks Perry with it) fight back! Waa-ha! (Perry wipes away the grease on his fur, takes off his fedora, and produces a hot dog from out of it.) Woo-ho-ho. Your hot dog is no match for my bratwurst!
(Doof and Perry fight each other like Yoda and Count Dooku in Attack of the Clones. At one point, Doof reaches out his hand as if he's attempting to use the Force. Perry looks behind him at a lightbulb bolted to the wall and then looks back at Doof.)
Doofenshmirtz: No, no, no, just kidding! I—But I made you look, didn't I? Huh? Huh? 
(Cut back to the backyard, where Candace is still being flipped around like a rag doll.)
Candace: Wait a minute, is that Jeremy? What's he doing here? (Gets slapped by an orca tail.)
Jeremy: Hey, Candace, did you get my messages?
Candace: Messages? (Gets slapped by another orca tail and looks at her phone, while riding the dolphin.) Eleven messages? (Rides the dolphin, which goes through a hoop held up by Ferb.) He called me!
(The crowd goes wild.)
Jeremy: Whoo! Go, Candace!
(Goldie then jumps through the hoop.) 
(Cut back to the fight. We now hear lightsabre-esque sound effects coming from the bratwurst and the frankfurter. Doofenshmirtz gets swiped by Perry's hot dog and falls backwards, dropping his bratwurst. Perry points his hot dog to Doof in victory, but Doof eats it.)
Doofenshmirtz: Not so hotsy-totsy now! Are you, Perry the Platypus?
(Perry swipes his tail, which cuts through the bratwurst. A piece of it hits a button on the inator.)
Computer: Fire.
(The inator activates.) 
(Cut to the backyard, where Candace is happily floating on her back.)
Candace: He called me! I can't believe he really called me!
(The dolphins and orcas jump up in a grand finale. The inator ray freezes the aquarium water, breaking the pool apart. Candace lands on the ice.)
Candace: Whoa, what happened to all the fish? (slips on the ice) Aaaaaaaahhh!!! (She falls and gets caught by Jeremy.) Oh, my!
Jeremy: Wow! You were great back there!
Candace: Thanks!
Phineas: Great show, Ferb! I don't remember freezing the tank being part of the finale, but that rocked! Looks like it didn't freeze all the way through. Nice. 
(Cut back to Doof and Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: Eh, so what? Big deal. So it missed it's initial target. A minor setback. (Perry puts his finger on one of the bratwursts in the pile.) No wait! You'll disrupt the pile's equilibrium! (Perry takes the bratwurst out, nothing happens.) Well, hot diggity do— (All the bratwursts fall onto Doofenshmirtz and crash through the building and go down the streets with the Hot-Dog-Vendor-Revenge-inator.) Curse you, Perry the Platypus!! 
(Cut back to the backyard.)
Jeremy: I've been trying to call all day.
Candace: Uh... hehehehehehehehehehehe...
Jeremy: (puts her down) Do you wanna go do something?
Candace: Omigosh, yes!
(She bends down, and her butt somehow causes the ice block to move, taking the stadium seats with it. Linda's station wagon parks.)
Jeremy: Really, you didn't even look at your messages?
Candace: Yeah, I know.
Jeremy: That's okay, Candace. You looked like you were pretty busy.
(Linda approaches the two.)
Candace: Mom!
Jeremy: Hi, Mrs. Flynn.
Linda: Hi, Jeremy.
Candace: You have to come to the backyard! (Pushes Linda into the backyard) Phineas and Ferb built a whole aquarium with whales and everything!
Jeremy: I'll call ya in a little while.
Candace: You'll see! (with her eyes closed) Tada!!
(Dramatic impact plays)
Phineas: Hi, Mom!
(Pause, Candace stares pointing with a deadpan expression on her face)
Linda: Look, honey. I brought ya a book.
(Long pause)
Candace: Did Jeremy just say he'll call me in a little while? (gets out her phone and dials) How long is that supposed to be?! 
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb up in the tree. Phineas is looking through binoculars.)
Phineas: Well, I guess Goldie and her friends are headed to the ocean.
Ferb: Well, you know what they say, if you love something, set it free.
Phineas: Yeah, we do that every day with Perry. (Perry, also up in the tree, chatters.) Oh, there you are, Perry, we were just talkin' about you. 

(Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house. In Phineas and Ferb's room, the boys are sick in bed.)
♪ Na, na, na ♪
Linda: Okay, boys, I'm off to the store for as much Mucus Be Gone as I can carry. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Phineas: No worries, Mom. We'll be perfectly fine.
Linda: Well, all right. Bye.
Phineas/Ferb: Bye, Mom.
(Linda closes door)
Candace: (Opens door) Aw, you guys really are sick.
Phineas: Oh, you know us. (Sneezes) Nothing can ever keep us down.
Candace: That's great! You're completely incapacitated! That means I have the whole day to myself! I could spend all day on my Jeremy scrapbook, or I could work on Jeremy, the board game. Or I could go to the mall and watch Jeremy work from my hiding place behind the Weave and Wig. The possibilities are endless! This is gonna be the best sick day ever, for me! (Slams door)
Phineas: Best sick day ever, huh? (Song plays) Ferb, I know what we're gonna... (Coughs, song distorts) All right, Ferb, implement our Sick Day Video Game Backup System. Ready local area network.
(Ferb presses a button on a remote, and a blue screen descends. Isabella and Phineas appear on-screen)
Isabella: Whatcha doin'? (Sneezes)
(Ferb appears on-screen)
Phineas: You too, huh?
Isabella: Where's everyone else?
(Baljeet and Buford appear on-screen)
Baljeet/Buford: Here we are.
(All but Ferb and Buford cough and sneeze)
Phineas: So, everyone's sick in bed today, huh?
Buford: Nah, I'm just lazy.
Phineas: Cool, I think. Hey, where's Perry? 
(Perry puts on a surgeon mask, walks past Phineas and Ferb's room, puts on his fedora, and then continues running)
Major Monogram: Agent P, I didn't know you were a germaphobe. (at Carl) Carl, he's afraid of germs, just like you.
Carl: It's not the germs, sir, it's the garlic smell.
Major Monogram: If you have something to say, Carl, spit it out!
Carl: Ugh, never mind, sir.
(Perry takes off the surgeon mask)
Major Monogram: Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has been seen racking up huge bills in Brain, Bath, and Beyond, the area's largest Big Box Mind Control Warehouse store. Get to the bottom of it. Monogram out.
(Monitor static) 
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus. I've been expecting you. Sit anywhere, Perry the Platypus, make yourself at home. (laughs maniacally; puts helmet on Perry) So, what do you think of my De-Volitionator? Not to be confused with my De-Evolutionator from a few schemes ago. You see, volition is our ability to choose what we are going to do. Whereas evolution... eh, that's got something to do with monkeys, I think. But this allows me to take over your volition and control what you do. Like this, watch. (Electricity fizzing) How do you feel, Perry the Platypus?
(Perry chatters)
Doofenshmirtz: Well, it doesn't matter because I'm in control. Okay, turn, and... let's go outside and see what this baby can really do! And let's make this snappy, I gotta pick up my daughter by 5:00. You remember Vanessa, right? You know, you blew me up at her birthday party. 
Phineas: All right, gang, who wants to go first?
Isabella/Baljeet/Buford: (clamoring) Me! Me! Me!
Phineas: Let's let the computer decide.
Game Voice: Buford! Vs. Isabella!
Buford: I'm fighting a girl? This'll be easy!
Isabella: Ooh?!
Game Voice: Fight-uh!

Game Voice: Patch sash smack attack!

Game Voice: Isabella wins-uh!
Isabella: In your face, Buford! (Sniffles)

Vanessa: Thanks for driving me to the Scrapyard Invasion party, Mom.
Charlene: Now remember, I won't be able to pick you up afterwards 'cause I'm gonna be getting my nails done. So, I have your Dad picking you up.
Vanessa: Oh, that's cool. If by cool you mean completely embarrassing me in front of the only people whose opinions matter to me.
Charlene: At least he's trying.
Vanessa: Yes, very trying. Do you remember the last time he picked me up?
(Flashback)
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa, over here! Hop in!
(Everyone laughs)
Ugh, don't ask!
(Flashback ends)
Vanessa: Maybe you should just let me off here. At least I can start the party off with my dignity intact.
Charlene: Whoops, too late! (She stops the car, opening the front passenger door window) Look, it's the only people whose opinions matter to you.
Vanessa: (Waves, embarrassed) Hey, Johnny.
Johnny: Hey, Vanessa. Nice ride.
Vanessa: Yeah, hold on to that thought. My dad's picking me up. (Exits car)
Charlene: Have fun at the dump. Watch out for medical waste!

Ferb: Oh, I'd never do that. 
(Dance music)
Vanessa: Look at all the freaks here.
Johnny: I know, huh? Our peeps. (Shows the phone) And look at this. We're on the Internet.
Vanessa: What?
Johnny: This whole place is wired. They've got cameras everywhere. There's like, dozens of live feeds. Here's the crowd dancing, the DJ. Here's the restroom.
Teen Boy #1: Not cool, man.
Vanessa: Wow! This is like the coolest midday scrapyard rave ever! 
Phineas: Okay, Isabella and Baljeet won their battles. So who am I gonna battle?
Game Voice: Phineaaas! Vs. Phineaaas!
Phineas: Okay. At least I'm evenly matched.
Game Voice: Fight-uh!

Game Voice: Phineaaas! Wins-uh!
Phineas: I'm kicking my own butt! 
Doofenshmirtz: Left foot, right foot., left foot, right foot. Okay, now, skip!
(Perry chatters angrily, but a music box melody plays as he skips along the sidewalk)
Doofenshmirtz: (In a sing-song manner) I'm controlling Perry the Platypus... and... uh... slap yourself! (He pushes a button on the remote. Perry slaps himself) Haha! (He pushes the button several more times, forcing Perry to slap himself over and over again) Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself, hahaha! Hahaha! I can make you do anything!!! (Gasps as he gets an idea) Oh, oh! Eat that gum off the sidewalk!
(A horror theme plays as Perry picks up a piece of ABC gum off the sidewalk)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, gross! You're really going to do it? Perry the Platypus, that's so unsanitary! Didn't your mother ever tell you not to do that?
(Perry is struggling against Doofenshmirtz's command to eat the gum)
Doofenshmirtz: Ooh! Oh, it looks so horrible! I can't look, I can't look! Stop! Stop, Perry the Platypus, stop!
(Perry stops, looking relieved)
Doofenshmirtz: (Laughs)Oh, man, that was great. (A beat)
Doofenshmirt: Now put it back down and do it again. 
(Back at the rave, Vanessa and Johnny are dancing in the thick of the crowd)
Johnny: Great place for a dance party, huh?
Vanessa: Yeah! I just saw a rat! (her phone rings) Ugh, it's my dad. (answers it) Yes, Dad?
Doofenshmirtz: (Yelling excitedly) PERRY THE PLATYPUS ALMOST ATE GUM OFF THE SIDEWALK!!!
Vanessa: (Annoyed) Is that what you called to tell me?
Doofenshmirtz: No, no. I- I just called to remind you that I will be picking up you and your Visigoth friends up after the dance.
Vanessa: Dad, it's goths, not Visigoths. And they're punks, not goths. (Hangs up)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah. (Turns to a Visigoth who is standing next to the park bench he and Perry are sitting on) Sorry, Alaric, I thought they were Visigoths. You're not going to impress the punks. You're free to go.
Alaric: (Grumpily, as he leaves) But I still get my pay raise!
Doofenshmirtz: See, this is what it's like having a teenage daughter. You're never cool enough. Anyway... (With a gleeful look) Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? 
(Perry is now pushing Doofenshmirtz in a grocery cart down the sidewalk)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus, I can't believe you removed this shopping cart from the supermarket parking lot! You must be feeling so evil! (Laughs) Oh, look at the time. I've got to go pick up Vanessa. Mush, Perry the Platypus, mush!
(As they enter the Scrapyard)
A junk yard? Why can't they have their party in a nice place, like the Caribou Lodge? You ever been to the Caribou Lodge, Perry the Platypus? They have a nice spread there.
Teen Boy #2: Sweet ride, dude.
Doofenshmirtz: Thank you. Platypus power. (His remote begins beeping) Uh oh. Batteries are low. Hmm... (He looks around for a place to recharge his remote) Take five, Perry the Platypus. (Perry sits down on the ground, and Doofenshmirtz runs over to an amp and plugs in the remote) Whew, that was close. (The remote and the amp begin glowing green; he screams) Ow! Oh! Oh! 
(The green glow goes through the power lines across Danville, all the way to the Flynn-Fletcher residence. It interrupts Buford, who is about to jump on Phineas in the game. The screen goes to static)
Phineas: Uh oh, power surge.
(The screen now shows Perry at the junkyard)
Phineas: No, wait! Ooh, a Perry level. Nice graphics.
Doofenshmirtz: (On screen) Okay, Perry the Platypus, all charged up and ready to... (Pushes button on remote repeatedly, but nothing happens) Oh, great. Now what's wrong with it? (Perry's left arm moves) I didn't do that!
Phineas: I did that! But I only seem to have control of his left arm.
Isabella: Let me try! (She pushes buttons on her controller) Cool! I've got control of his left leg!
Buford: I've got his right arm. (Perry is forced to slap himself again) Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? (Laughs)
(Ferb lifts up his right leg)
Phineas: Ferb's got right leg.
Baljeet: Oh! I have got back and forth!
(Perry moves all of his limbs and goes back and forth)
Doofenshmirtz: What's wrong with it? Stop that! Stop it!
Baljeet: What is the goal of this game?
Phineas: I'm not sure.
Buford: Who cares? Let's just fight that old pharmacist!
(Phineas' and Ferb's Monitors appear after Buford, Isabella's, and Baljeet's)
Phineas: Sure! This must be the boss level. All right, guys, we work as a team on this one.
Doofenshmirtz: Uh-oh!
(Perry does the actions as Phineas says them, and everyone working the limbs is in sync)
Phineas: Ready stance, now taunt and... jump!
(Perry knocks over Doofenshmirtz)
Phineas: Great leap, leg team!
(Perry is jumping on Doofenshmirtz's stomach. There are flies buzzing around him)
Buford: I bet those flies are power-ups.
Phineas: Let's see.
(Perry grabs one and eats it, looking utterly disgusted)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh! Perry the Platypus! Gross! That's worse than sidewalk gum!
(But it works, and Perry does a flip, kicking Doofenshmirtz in the face)
Isabella: Oh yeah!
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus, what's gotten into you? (gets up and runs away)
Buford: He's trying to get away!
Phineas: Not on our watch!
(Perry follows him up a stack of junk)
Doofenshmirtz: Now, now, Perry the Platypus...
(Perry jumps on him again)
Baljeet: Eat pig iron, old pharmacist!
(Doofenshmirtz has picked up an umbrella)
Doofenshmirtz: Stay back, Perry the Platypus! Back!!!
Phineas: Buford!
Buford: I'm on it!
(As Doofenshmirtz swings the umbrella at Perry, he grabs it)
Isabella: On my mark, guys!
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, my. Wait, what...
Isabella: Baljeet, in!
Doofenshmirtz: Wait, why are you moving so deliberately...?
Baljeet: Roger!
Doofenshmirtz: What are you doing?!
Phineas: Legs...jump...Buford!
(With Buford's help, Perry whacks Doofenshmirtz in the head with the umbrella)
Buford: Idiot!
(Doofenshmirtz groans)
Phineas: Finish him off, Ferb!
(Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz down the pile of junk)
Phineas: Nice one.
(Doofenshmirtz somersaults down the hill. Ferb blows on his game controller)
Phineas: We won, gang! And if I may be so bold, I claim the right to throw Perry's hat in the air.
(Perry takes off the hat, and tosses it. It lands on the camera that was giving them the picture for the game. The screen goes to static once more)
Phineas: Huh. Game over, I guess.
Isabella/Baljeet/Buford: Aww. 
(The party is still going full blast. Doofenshmirtz gets his hands in a bucket of glue, and slides right into the DJ booth, which has been vacated by the actual DJ. He puts his hands on the records on the table and the music instantly stops)
Vanessa: Dad?
Johnny: That's your dad?
Vanessa: No!
(Pause)
Teen Boy #3: I was at the Caribou Lodge once, and it was just like this.
(The entire crowd starts to boo. Doofenshmirtz is sweating nervously. Perry looks back at him with an annoyed expression, then sighs and rolls his eyes)
Vanessa: Dad, why?
Doofenshmirtz: (Chuckles while sweating) Who's up for charades?
(Perry beckons Doofenshmirtz from under the table)
Perry the Platypus, what are you doing down here?
(When he reemerges, he is wearing the Devolition-ator helmet, and making a beat with the records glued to his fingers. Perry is controlling him underneath the DJ table)
Vanessa: Dad?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, hi, Vanessa.
Vanessa: Dad, what are you doing?

Doofenshmirtz: She thinks I'm cool!
(The crowd cheers) 
Phineas: Well, it looks like all our fevers have broken.

Phineas: Except for Buford, who managed to get sick by laying in bed all day. (at Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry. Just in time for your walk.
(A weary Perry chatters) 
(Scene opens at the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Phineas: I don't know about you, Ferb, but I think bubbles have a great sense of humor. Look at what that bubble's doing to my face. (laughs) You make me laugh out loud, bubble.
(Ferb blows a bubble to look at his face. The reflection of his face turns into Baljeet's.)
Baljeet: Hello!
(At first Ferb is alarmed, but then the bubble pops, revealing the real Baljeet standing behind it.)
Phineas: Hey, Baljeet.
Baljeet: What are you guys doing?
Phineas: We're blowing bubbles and relaxing.
Baljeet: Oh, I remember being relaxed, but that was before I had this! (shows Phineas and Ferb a schedule)
Phineas: That looks like a color coded schedule.
Baljeet: That's because it is. Every minute of my entire day is planned out right here. Remember how you told me to seize the day? Well, consider it seized!
Phineas: That's not exactly what I meant.
Buford: Hey, is it time for me yet?
Baljeet: Not quite. (brief pause) Okay, now. (Buford licks his finger and sticks it in Baljeet's ear)
Phineas: Do you have any extra time for a bubble?
Baljeet: Uh, I guess I have time for one.
Buford: Oh, oh! Can I blow a huge one so I can crawl inside it and float around like a little woodland pixie? (stops, realizing his mistake) Did I just say that out loud?
Phineas: Yes, yes you did. But that actually sounds fun minus the pixie part. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! There's no better way to see Danville than from inside a huge bubble.
Buford: I wanna float around! (again realizing his mistake) Like men.
Phineas: Wanna come, Baljeet?
Baljeet: My schedule is extremely tight. I doubt I even have a second to answer your question. Maybe if I move my polka recital back. Okay.
Phineas: Great! So you're coming?
Baljeet: No! I moved polka back so I could answer your question! It would take some major rearranging, but I think I can at least come and watch you make the bubble.
Phineas: Awesome! Hey, where's Perry?
Baljeet: Haha! Right on time! I had Perry's absence on my schedule!
(Perry enters his lair. Lights are off and everything is black)
Major Monogram: Shh! Quiet, Carl! He's coming!
(Lights come on, revealing the room filled with balloons)
Major Monogram/Carl: Surprise!
Carl: Alright!
Major Monogram: Happy Birthday, Agent P! (blows into kazoo) (awkward pause) It's not your birthday, is it? (Perry shakes his head) Are we close?
Carl: Told ya!
Major Monogram: Put a sock in it, Carl! (clears throat) I, uh, was a bit too busy planning your party, so I'm not sure what Doofenshmirtz is up too, but I am sure that it's no good. Get to the bottom of it!
Linda: So, Candace, are you ready to do some practice driving for your permit?
Candace: I'm easing my way into the driver's seat. I start with what's familiar and slide into the new.
Linda: Well start sliding. We've got errands to run.
Candace: Okay, you drive!
Linda: Your dad says you're already good at parallel parking.
Candace: That was in the backyard! That's way different than the open road!
Linda: Candace, I thought you wanted to be the first of your friends to have a driver's license.
Candace: Okay, I'm sliding.
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.! ♪
(Perry enters the building)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus, I'm so glad you're here. I did get your invite to your birthday party over the internet, and naturally, I couldn't go, since it was most likely a trap. Anyway, I got you this. (hands Perry a birthday card) It's just a card, but here you go. (card traps Perry) Surprise! Haha! I finally figured out why my evil schemes always fail. You see, I am totally, completely, unlikeable. No, really, so I asked myself, "what are the two most liked things on the planet?" The answer? Country music and western music. So now, I'm bringing them together for the first time. I'm calling it "Country and Western Music." I know, I know. I'm brilliant, right?
(Phineas and Ferb are at the park working on the bubble design)
Phineas: Great bubble design, Ferb. Now all we need is the missing bubble ingredient.
Isabella: Hey guys. Whatcha doin'?
Baljeet: Making changes to my schedule.
Phineas: We're building a machine to make the biggest, most durable bubble ever.
Baljeet: Oh, right. Nobody ever asks what Baljeet is doing.
Phineas: We have just about everything we need for our durable bubble, but if you guys wanna help out, we still need some sap from a maracanut tree.
Isabella: Yeah, we can definitely do that.
Phineas: Excellent! While they're doing that, we can finish the design on the transponder. See you girls back at the field!
Doofenshmirtz: I know what you're thinking, "But Doof, you have a terrible singing voice! Well, feast your eyes on this little baby! (unveils a cowboy hat) Ta-da! I call it the Yodelinator! Pretty cool, eh? Oh, right. You just think it's a big cowboy hat. It's so much more! (presses a button on the hat) See? Huh? See? It's designed to make my singing voice sweet and mellifluous. So, my first gig is in an hour. Come on, you can help me hand out fliers. Everyone's going to (singsong) love me! 
(The car is at an intersection; a semi-truck behind them is honking its horn impatiently)
Linda: You can do this, Candace! Just look into the turn and ease your foot off the brake.
Candace: I'm l-l-l-l-looking into the turn....(gasps as she sees Phineas, Ferb, and the rest of the kids with the bubble machine in the park) (just as a bus with two monsters on the side pulls up, blocking the view) Mom, look! Phineas and Ferb!
Linda: Candace, I don't find that funny.
Candace: No! Behind the bus! (honks horn) They were building some kind of contraption! I'll show you! (swerves left)
Linda: Oh good. Now we're-- Candace, slow down!
Phineas: Nice work as usual, Ferb! All we need now is the final ingredient.
Isabella: Hey, Phineas! We got the sap you guys needed. Here! (hands him a vial)
Phineas: Thanks! (pours sap into bubble machine. Ferb pushes a button and turns a valve. The machine begins blowing the giant bubble, which slowly encases the gang as Phineas speaks) At this stage, the maracanut sap isn't fully congealed. So we can pass through the semi-permeable membrane with ease. (bubble walls give way and he is inside the bubble) Voila!
Isabella: Girls, I think we just earned our Passing-Through-A-Semi-Permeable-Membrane patches! (Fireside Girls cheer)
(Linda and Candace pull up to the park entrance, but the kids are now gone)
Candace: See, there they...... (they see only the machine)
Linda: Perhaps I should get tired of asking this, but....what am I supposed to be looking at?
Candace: Ugh! They were right there in the...(sees the bubble floating behind a building) Hold onto something, Mom. (floors the accelerator)
(In the bubble)
Baljeet: Well, that was very entertaining, but that is all the time I have scheduled for. (notices how high they are) Oh, wait. You are already airborne. And I am already still with you. (begins to panic a little) I do not believe this! My schedule is totally blown! I am going to miss my polka recital!
Buford: I've heard you. It's a small loss.
(In the car; Candace still has the accelerator floored)
Linda: Candace, trash cans again!
(Candace crashes into the cans and knocks them over)
Candace: Oops, heh heh. My bad. Where'd they go? (sticks her head out the window to see them floating away)
Linda: Candace, I think we've all had enough of your driving!
Candace: Not now, Mom! I have to get this car into the sky! (drives at full speed again)
Linda: (screaming) Candaaaace!
(In the bubble)
Baljeet: Oh, no! How long are we going to be up here?
Phineas: (reclining) Awhile.
Baljeet: And...and how do you even STEER this thing?
Phineas: We're at the mercy of the breeze.
Baljeet: (laughs nervously) Sure, when you say it like that, it sounds relaxing.
Phineas: Hey everybody! Downdraft! (They float down and pass under a bridge)
Baljeet: Oh no, look out! Power lines!
Isabella: Girls, you know what to do!
Isabella and the Fireside Girls: Leeeeaaaannnn! (they all slam against the side of the bubble and it swerves, avoiding the power lines. Everyone cheers)
Baljeet: Cactus garden!
Isabella: Lean! (this time, everyone slams against the side and the bubble swerves into an alleyway)
Baljeet: PUBLIC ART!
Gretchen: With our angle of descent, leaning will be ineffectual!
Everybody else: What?
Gretchen: We're gonna craaash!
Baljeet: Oh no! I knew I should not have forsaken the rigid beauty of my candy-colored schedule!
(Baljeet begins hyperventilating and the bubble begins growing steadily)
Phineas: The bubble is expanding. It's Baljeet's breathing! (Baljeet keeps going) It's blowing the bubble up! Everybody breathe heavy like Baljeet!
Fireside Girls and Isabella: Yes sir!
(Everyone hyperventilates and the bubble floats high over the buildings)
Phineas: We're doing it! (Everyone cheers) Baljeet, you totally saved us!
Baljeet: When in danger, I always hyperventilate.
(At the park concert)
Cowboy singer: Thank you, everyone! Thank you very much!
Doofenshmirtz: I'm next, Perry the Platypus. After this concert, I will be the most well liked man in the Tri-State Area!
(He goes onstage and begins strumming his guitar)

Person 3: Yeah! It stinks so bad I wanna break somethin'!

Person 3: That really wasn't worth it.
(Everyone gets up and leaves while chatting)
Person 2: You can't mix country and western! They's two completely different types of music!
Person 4: That song was horrible!
Person 5: Yeah, those lyrics was way too on the nose!
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, that wasn't as successful as I'd hoped.... (grabs jet-pack and puts it on) but at least I can beat a hasty retreat before I'm too humiliated!
(He revs up the jet-pack and it shoots into the sky, tearing his clothes off and leaving him in his underwear and socks. The underwear is patterned with Agent P heads. Agent P notices this and gives him a dumb look)
Doofenshmirtz: Huh? (laughs nervously) For your information, I had these way before I met you. (jet-pack shoots by and he walks away) (Halfheartedly) Okay, see you tomorrow.
(In the car)
Linda: Candace, watch where you're going!
Candace: They're around here somewhere. (she sees the bubble) Ooh! Ooh! (laughs crazily) There they are! Headed for the old drawbridge! You're mine!
(The jet-pack slams into the back of the car and starts rocketing it forward)
Linda: Candace, stop!
Candace: I can't! (the drawbridge opens and they rocket into the sky. Linda screams and covers her eyes. The bubble floats in front of them) There they are! I told you! I--Mom, open your eyes!
Linda: (terrified) Not until we're back on the ground!
Candace: (they shoot past the bubble) Mooooom!
Phineas: That was Candace driving.
Ferb: Her car control has gotten a lot better.
(The car lands)
Candace: Mom, we're back on the ground! Ahhhhhhh! (eye twitches)
Linda: Okay Candace, now just gently...apply...the brake.
Candace: I'm tryiiiiing!
(Back in the bubble...)
Baljeet: Wow. This whole relaxation thing is...well, relaxing.
(Back in the car, Candace's eye twitches again)
Linda: Candace, at least take your foot off the gas.
Candace: (enraged) Oh, you think? You think?! (lifts her foot) There! How's that?! Is that better!?!
(The jetpack's flames go out and Linda screams. The car turns and Candace hits the break, and the car parallel parks near a playground)
Linda: Well, guess your father was right. You do have parallel parking down.
(The bubble containing the kids floats above them, Candace sees it)
Candace: Look! There they are!
Linda: Candace, I can't see anything. "They" who?
Candace: The boys! They're up in there in the -- (the bubble pops, releasing the kids onto the rides) Ugh.
Linda: Oh, hi boys!
Phineas: (riding a bouncy animal) Hi, Mom! Nice parking, Candace.
Candace: What?! No! It's not -- but they were up -- (leans on the car wheel, setting off the horn)
Phineas: Well, Ferb, I guess we should consider this day: Seized. (sees Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry.
(Perry chatters)
(Scene opens up in the Flynn-Fletcher home.) 
Linda: Well, I think that's it. You have both our cell-phone numbers, all emergency contacts, and the number of the hotel we'll be staying in at the antique shower-head convention. What do you plan on doing tonight?
Candace: I thought I'd have a few friends over, like Stacy and Jenny. Is that okay?
Linda: Sure! But no wild parties.
Candace: Well, I guess I'll have to cancel the death metal band and the fire dancers. (Linda frowns) I kid!
Linda: Lawrence, you're not wearing that on the plane.
Lawrence: (wearing antique showerhead) I'm not on the plane yet.
Linda: We'll be back this time tomorrow.
Phineas: Mom and Dad, your cab is here.
Linda: (To Candace) Bye hon! You're in charge.
Lawrence: Mind your sister, boys.
All: Bye! 
Candace: Hey, Stace. What're you doing tonight? Do you and Jenny want to come over and just hang out?
Phineas: Do you need help with entertaining or snacks?
Candace: Listen, under no circumstances do I want you to do anything crazy. Or anything at all for that matter. Just go up to your room and get out of my hair. Vamoose!
Phineas: Are you sure? We can make a nacho launcher, or a dip fountain.
Candace: No.
Phineas: How about a wasabi slide?
Candace: No. (To Stacy) Sorry about that, Stace. Come over around... Oh wait, I have another call. Hello?
Phineas: (from the phone) How about a mustard-go-round?
Candace: PHINEAS!!
Phineas: Okay. Hey, where's Perry? 
(Perry puts on his fedora and opens a drawer where he slides through a tube)
Major Monogram: Come in, Agent P. We've been having trouble with our pipes getting mixed up with the city's dump system. We aren't one hundred percent sure where you'll end up.
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus?!
Major Monogram: Where are you, Agent P? (Perry points his wrist communicator at Doofenshmirtz) Great googly moogly! Well, hang tight, I'll give you your mission. Doofenshmirtz is up to no good. He has been seen snooping around --
Doofenshmirtz: Around the neighborhood apartment. Yes, I've; yes, I've been doing that.
Major Monogram: He's also been buying --
Doofenshmirtz: Buying electrical equipment.
Major Monogram: And checking --
Both: -movie starting times online.
Major Monogram: Let me tell it!
Doofenshmirtz: I wanna tell it! I - want - to tell it! Doofenshmirtz... that is... wait... (he is cut off by Major Monogram; exclaims in frustration)
Major Monogram: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la... (clears throat) So, get him, Agent P, and good luck.
Doofenshmirtz: Thank you.
Major Monogram: Not you.
Doofenshmirtz: Too late, I'm lucky now. (laughs; traps Perry) You like that? I call it a trap-a-lounger, because it's loungy and trappy all at the same time. 
(Scene shifts to the Flynn-Fletcher house, where the door bell rings. Candace walks to the door and answers it. Enter Stacy and Jenny, squealing in excitement.)
Stacy: Yeah!
Jenny: Whoo-hoo!
Stacy: (she and Jenny walk in) I took the liberty of bringing some DVDs for our party viewing pleasure.
Candace: Uh, it's not a party.
Stacy: For our not-a-party viewing pleasure. (Enter Jenny's cousin, Sara)
Jenny: Candace, this is my cousin, Sara.
Sara: Hello.
Jenny: She's visiting for the weekend. Is it okay if she hangs out with us, too?
Candace: Well, my mom said I could have a couple people over. Sure, come on in.
Sara: (Candace closes the door) Hey, are you Phineas and Ferb's sister? That must be awesome for you.
Candace: Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you?
Stacy: So my mom told me to clean up my room and I didn't have any shoes on, so I started picking stuff up with my feet, and I turned it into a game with myself, like, "Can I Clean Up My Whole Room With My Feet?" And I did. (her cell phone rings) Oh, it's Coltrane. Hello?
Coltrane: (indistinct chattering over phone)
Stacy: (To Candace) Coltrane and Jeremy's gig got cancelled. Can they come over?
Candace: Over here? Uh, Coltrane and Jeremy? Hey, what's two more?
Stacy: (to Coltrane) Bring it! (she hangs up) Awesome! 
(Scene shifts to D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: So, let me tell you my evil scheme. Not too long ago, I used to sit right over there and watch free movies on the drive-in movie screen across the street. Of course, I didn't get the sound, so I'd make up my own dialogue. It was fun. (changes his tone of voice to sound gruff and deeper) "Sheila, I love you, but now I have to defuse this bomb." (in normal voice) See? Good stuff! Gripping! But now look! They built a giant condominium blocking my view. I tried to make up dialogue for it... (in gruff movie voice) "I'm a condominium. I'm just standing there." (In normal voice) See? Where's the fun in that? It's always the same, "I'm a building." There's no story. And I know what you're thinking, why not just move my armchair over to that window over there with the unblocked view? Well, then I would have to move this little table, too, and the lamp, and this is the only electrical outlet. It seems easier to get rid of the building. So, that's why I invented this: the Go-Away-inator! One blast of this ray, and that building, and everyone in it, (snaps his fingers) will instantly be transported somewhere else. Here on this wheel, I've written many undesirable locations. With a pull of this string, a site is randomly chosen, and good-bye low-rent condo, hello Hollywood high-budgets! (laughs maniacally) 
(Scene shifts back to the Flynn-Fletcher house, where Jeremy and the Incidentals have arrived.)
Jeremy: Hey, Candace. Thanks for having us over to your party.
Candace: Oh, it's not a party, and I'm glad you and your entire band could make it over.
Jeremy: We wrote a new song. I'd love to test it out on you guys.
Stacy: Aww.
Jenny/Sara: Ooh.
Candace: Uh, as long as we agree that it's just a test. This isn't a "party" with a "band" playing, it's just a small get-together, and you're just gonna lightly strum a test song.

(During the song, Stacy, Jenny, and Sara dance along. They cheer Jeremy and the Incidentals as they play. Candace snaps her fingers to the song nervously. Then, the door bell rings. Candace walks to the door and answers it. Enter three teenage girls.)
Girl #1: Hey, we were just walking by and heard the music. Isn't this Phineas and Ferb's house?
Candace: Well, yes, but...
Girl #1: Awesome!
Girl #3: Hey, Phineas and Ferb are having a party!
Candace: But, but, but, hold on... (chuckles nervously) It's just an intimate get together. (tries to close the door, but gets slammed in the face as more teens walk in)
Teens: Hey, Phineas and Ferb!/Hey, guys, a party!
Candace: It's not a party.
Girl: This is awesome! (more teens join in Jeremy and the Incidentals and dance along) 
(Phineas and Ferb come down the stairs and wave at the party teens)
Phineas: Heeeeeey.
Ferb: When we get our own place, it'll be like this everyday.
Phineas: Let's find Candace. 
(Sara turns up the volume on the amplifier and dances)
Candace: No, no! No, keep it down. Just going to turn it down a little. (chuckles nervously) ♪ La, la, la... ♪ (tries to unplug the amplifier, but Phineas and Ferb interrupt her)
Phineas: Hey, Candace. Cool party.
Candace: It's not a party, it's an intimate get-together.
Jeremy: Hey, Candace. Thanks so much for hosting this.
Candace: Oh, sure. Rock on... (Jeremy leaves) What are you looking at?! If you want to stay down here, sit over there and stay out of the way.
Phineas: (leaving) Okay.
(someone throws a bag of Pork Rinds)
Guy: Pork Rinds, coming your way!
Candace: Uh, snacks should not be airborne! (Snatches it from him but the bag tears and the chips fall to the ground) 
(At D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Any minute now, Perry the Platypus, that building will be relocated and I can enjoy my view! It just needs to warm up. (turns on the Go-Away-inator) Let's savor this moment. Right now, my plan is working, you're trapped, and the inator is warming up. Yes, these are the good moments, Perry the Platypus. These are the good moments. 
(Back at the Flynn-Fletcher house...)
Guy: Is this the Phineas and Ferb party?
Guy #2: Sure is.
Guy: I brought Pork Rinds.
Guy #2: More pork rinds!
Candace: I didn't invite these people. Who are they? Now what?
Party members: (Chanting) Chip! Chip! Chip! Chip! Chip!
Candace: What's going on here?
(Phineas and Ferb are eating potato chips)
Party members: Yeah!
Candace: Stop encouraging them!
Phineas: We're just eating potato chips at a party.
Guy: Phineas and Ferb parties rule! (all cheering)
Candace It's not their party, it's my party! And it's not a party, it's an intimate get together. (Shattering) (Gasps) What was that? Put that down, pardon me, use a napkin! What's my science teacher doing here?
Teacher: I never miss a Phineas and Ferb party!

Lawrence: Oh, would you like to yank my chain?
Linda: (at the camera) Yes, yes I would.
(Linda pulls the cord on Lawrence's shower-hat) 
(At D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Any minute now, my inator will be all warmed up. I should've gone solid state, but this has got the tubes. It's old school Perry the... Hey, you've escaped! (grunts) 
(Scene shifts to the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Candace: Everybody out the back way! Let's go! Out, out, out! (leads everyone into the backyard)
Jeremy: Great idea, moving the party outside. It was getting hot in there. Hey guys, let's keep rocking!
Party members: Candace party! Candace party!
Candace: No! Now they're all partying in the backyard!
Party members: Candace party! Candace party!
Candace: Why aren't they leaving?
(Linda and Lawrence arrive.)
Party members: Candace party! Candace party!
Candace: (Gasps) They're here!
(At D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: It's too late, Perry the Platypus, I've pulled the string! Any second, these condos will disappear, and I will watch free movies. And you can't do a thing about it.
(Perry pulls the rug. The ray from the Go-away inator hits the party members, making them disappear.)
Candace: (gasp) The entire party has disappeared! Of course! The same divine intervention that takes things away from you guys...took the party away for me! I'm saved!
Phineas: I wonder where the party went.
Ferb: Someplace nice, I hope.
(At D.E.I. The sides of Doofenshmirtz's pants appear to have all the party members in them.)
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: Well, obviously, something's amiss. Uhh, let's review: The Go-away inator which missed the condo, should've zapped whatever it hit to an undesirable location. Let me check my undesirable location wheel. (grabs out binoculars) "Stonehenge", "Burbank"... (looks where spinner stopped) "My Pants"?! Why would I even write that there?! Oh, I see, I got it confused with my dry-cleaning wheel. Oh, okay, but...why do I have a dry-cleaning wheel? (in gruff movie voice) "I am a dry-cleaning wheel. Why do I exist?" (normal voice) Perry the Platypus, be a mensch and push the reverse button, would you?
(Perry presses the reverse button on the Go-Away inator. The ray hits the backyard as Linda and Lawrence enter.)
Candace: Mom and Dad are here!
(The party members materialize behind Candace in the backyard. Linda and Lawrence march up to her.)
Candace: Hello, Mother, Father. What are you doing back so soon? I hope everything's okay. (pause) There's a party behind me, isn't there?
Party members: Candace party! Candace party! Candace party!
Linda: Candace, I trusted you. I can't believe you threw a party!
Candace: I didn't throw a party!
Linda: Well, then, whose party is it?
Teenage boys: (open door) Candace party! Candace party!
Linda: Young lady, you are so BUSTED!! Tell your friends to go straight home and then go straight up to your room!
Teenage boy 1: (as the Party Members groan sadly) Oh, man! Hey, everybody, the Candace party is over.
(The Party Members groan sadly again)
Phineas: Candace, if it makes you feel any better, you accidentally threw the most outrageous party of the summer!
Candace: Thanks, guys. I'll see you in a week. (goes upstairs)
(Perry comes back)
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry. You missed Candace's party.
Ferb: Totally, a platypus would have put it over the edge.
(Perry chatters) 
(At D.E.I.)
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: Oh, Vanessa! Thank goodness you're here! A platypus has tied me up in my own pants!
Vanessa: How did my life get to the point where that is not a strange sentence to me?
(Pause)
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: (in gruff movie voice) "I'm your daughter. I will stop being sarcastic and untie you."
(Scene opens up at the Flynn-Fletcher household. The Flynn-Fletchers sit on a couch with Bob and Tiana.)
Phineas: Wow, Aunt Tiana, you and Bob have had so many cool adventures.
Tiana: I know huh? And here's a picture of Bob and me jumping out of a helicopter into the South American rainforest. Turn the page, Bob.
Bob: Okay!
Tiana: Oh, here's where we dodged all those man eating plants in the Amazon. Bob?
Bob: Okay!
Tiana: And here we are climbing the icy peaks of Kilimanjaro. I thought the view was just spectacular, but Bob was just--
Bob: Eh, okay.
Phineas: Where ya going next?
Tiana: To the Galapagos. We leave tomorrow.
Bob: You know, we’ve been on so many trips together, this time, I want to go with someone else...
(Everyone gasps)
Bob: ...My wife. Tiana, will you marry me?
Tiana: Okay!
Linda: How romantic.
Lawrence: Way to go Bob.
Phineas: Wow, corny. But apparently effective.
Linda: You could get married in the Galapagos!
Candace: No! You can't get married in the Galapagos. When I was little, you promised me that I would be your bridesmaid. What about my needs?
Linda: Candace!
Tiana: Oh, that's right. I did promise you that, didn't I? Well, we could go to the courthouse before we leave.
Bob: Okay!
Candace: No, not okay! We have to have a real wedding. We can have it in the backyard!
Linda: Candace, you can't plan a real wedding in a day.
Candace: Duh! (Rushes off and comes back wearing a dress) I've been planning this since I was 10! I could set up the perfect wedding and get you two kids married in a way you'll never forget, and have you on the plane to the Galapagos with time to spare. Now you and mom go to the salon to get up-dos, and French manicures. Then head to Tri-State Bridal and ask for Oga. Now go!
Linda: Okay then, wouldn't want Aunt Tiana taking her vows in safari wear!
Tiana: Candace, I know you're going to plan a wonderful wedding, especially with Phineas and Ferb helping.
Candace: What?!
Phineas: Right! Ferb, I know what we're going to do--
Candace: No, no no. You don't know what you're going to do today. They're going to build some sort of wedding rocket to the moon, or lawn gnome beach party of taffeta!
Tiana: Then you steer the boys in the right direction, and have fun, okay?
Bob: (Off screen, distant) Okay!
Phineas: (At Ferb) Lawn gnome beach party of taffeta. Make a note of that. 
(Scene switches to Candace sitting in the kitchen)
Candace: (At phone) Hello? Lake's Cakes? I'd like a 7-tiered.... Oh no, make that 10-tiered white cake with raspberry filled... (Beep) Please hold. (Click) Yes, Flowers? Oh, yes, I need something with smell... (Beep) Oh um, please hold. (Click) I'm back. I want something with cinnamon...

Phineas: Hey, sis.
Candace: Excuse me. (At Phineas and Ferb) Can't you see I'm busy? (At phone) Yes, I'm still here. Hold please! (At Phineas and Ferb) Will you two scram?
Phineas: Well, Ferb and I wanted to see how we could help.
Candace: Just go do something and get out of my way! (At phone) Huh? Oh no, not you. It's my... (At Phineas and Ferb) Go plan the grand entrance!
Phineas: Okay! (At Ferb) I guess we could make an entrance that's kinda grand. (Pause) So, have you seen Perry? 
(Scene switches to Perry's lair)
Major Monogram: ♪ I wanna wanna wanna have fun fun fun ♪ (Major Monogram's screen lifts to reveal Perry sliding down a chute to his chair) Agent P, thank goodness you're here. As you've probably heard by now, Danville's experiencing a shortage of decent, healthy food and someone's been buying up all supplies of unhealthy food additives. This has Doofenshmirtz written all over it. (Image pops up on screen with Doofenshmirtz's picture and signatures by the man himself) We have no idea why he signed it that many times, but anyways, we're all counting on you Agent P!

Candace: (At phone) No; I said crab puffs! (Beep) Please hold. (Click) Why would I want my cake in a vase? Oh, you're the florist, not the baker.
Phineas: (Off screen) Alright ladies, let's do a run through!
(Candace breathes out smoke through her nose) 
(Scene switches to Phineas and Ferb, staring up at the sky)
Phineas: (Through helicopter noise) Looking good Isabella! (Candace comes to the backyard) Oh, hey, sis!
Isabella: (Parachuting down from the helicopter) Hey, Candace!
Phineas: See Aunt Tiana, Bob, and the wedding photographer will parachute into their wedding, just like they did in South America. At the helicopters) Let's bring those puppies back down. We want to save our fuel for the actual grand entrance!
Candace: Absolutely not! You are off grand entrance duty. Just go take care of the flowers, while I order the cake. Got it?
Phineas: Well, I guess we could--
Candace: Just do it! And don't interrupt me. (Walks away)
Phineas: Wow, she's good. I'm going to have her plan my wedding. Ferb, make a note.
Isabella: (Off screen) I got it!

(Perry walks into an elevator, which is playing "Gitchee Gitchee Goo". The elevator door opens)
Doofenshmirtz: Surprise, Perry the Platypus! (Giggles madly) Okay, (Presses elevator button) enjoy your trip! (Giggles again) Oh, oh, the look on his face was priceless, (Giggles) Oh, here he comes back. Alright, try not to laugh, okay. Ahaha, did you enjoy the other floor—Wait, Perry? (Second elevator door opens revealing Perry) Perry the Platypus? (Goes inside the elevator) Huh, where did he go?
(Perry reaches an arm into the elevator Doofenshmirtz is in and pushes all the floor buttons)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, (Groans) No!
(Perry walks into Doofenshmirtz's apartment) 
(Scene switches to Candace)
Candace: No, no, not beef, chicken! Oh, you're the cake guy? (Beep) Oh, hold please. (Click) What? No I don't want to save money on my car insurance.
Phineas: Candace!
Candace: I told you not to interrupt me. (At phone) Not you, don't hang up. (At Phineas and Ferb) This better be good!
Phineas: Ferb and I just thought you'd like to see how the flowers turned out.
Candace: Oh! Why didn't you say so? (Walks into the backyard) Oh wow, this is so beautiful—Wait a minute, are these--?
Phineas: Venus flytraps! Just like in their adventure in the Amazon.
(Nearby flytrap makes a growling noise; Candace gasps)
Phineas: Don't worry Candace, they only have a taste for insects and small vermin. (Flytrap latches onto Candace’s head) Hey, he likes you!
Candace: Get this thing off me!
Phineas: (Removing the Venus flytrap off Candace) Are you okay?
Candace: One moment. (Dials on her phone) 
(Scene switches to Linda and Tiana. Linda’s phone begins to ring)
Linda: Hello? (Candace screams through the phone; Linda hangs up) So, are you and Bob thinking of having kids? 
(Scene switches back to Phineas, Ferb and Candace)
Phineas: So, what can we do next?
Candace: Next? What can you do next?!
Phineas: Well, Aunt Tiana said that we should help, and it is her wedding when you think about it.
Candace: Alright. But! No trampolines, no robots, no rollercoasters, no firework spectaculars, no native dancers, no running of the wildebeests-- 
(Scene switches to DEI. Doofenshmirtz stands grumpily in the elevator as it continues going through every floor)
Doofenshmirtz: (Walking into his apartment) You could have at least gotten into your trap. It's on the table. (Perry ties himself up) You know, I do appreciate you trying to mix it up, but I do have a schedule to keep. Ready? Let me show you my latest project. The Junk Food-inator! It sprays my special mix of boiling hot high-fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated coconut oil. To turn all healthy food into toasty warm junk food! Soon, everyone will become lethargic overweight blobs. Easily controlled by me! (Laughs) Because I will be the only one left eating healthy food, like these delicious broccolis! (Eats) Mm, well, the only problem is, I'm not quite used to the taste—- I'm used to eating the junk. I'll just dip it in here (Dips broccoli into the Junk Food-inator and eats it) Mmm, Oh that's much better! I could eat this all day. I can feel myself getting healthier. 
(Scene switches back to Candace)
Candace: --No giant robot groomsmen, no mechanized rice catapults, no rocket to the moon, no bringing the moon down to earth, just regular good old fashion wedding stuff like you might find at a regular everyday perfect wedding.
Phineas: Like?
Candace: Like—- Ice! It's summer, it's hot, people want something with ice, okay? Make ice.
(Venus flytrap growls and snaps at her, and Candace runs away screaming)
Phineas: Ferb, what do we have in the ice file? 
(Scene switches back to DEI. Doofenshmirtz's stomach has enlarged and he is pale with acne on his face)
Doofenshmirtz: I could eat this stuff all day. Just look at this lifelike glow I've acquired. I'm the picture of health! And all from eating nothing but this... ah, I don't know what's under here, but I think it's a vegetable. I'm as strong as an ox! (Squelching noise as his stomach pops out from his shirt. Doofenshmirtz breathes out heavily as he gets tired) But nobody else will be after fire off my Junk Food-inator. (Machine rumbles, but stops, having run out of corn syrup and coconut oil) I should really refill this. But you know (Yawns) I'm so tired. I should really take a nap first. (Falls over into Junk Food-inator and starts snoring) 
(Scene switches back to Candace)
Delivery Man: Yeah, the cakes all set up out back just like you asked.
Candace: Thank you!
Delivery Man: Hey, aren't you a little too young to be a wedding planner—Oof! 
Candace: No! (Slams door) No, I'm not! (Rushes out back) My perfect cake done! (She unveils the cake to have the strangest assortment of tiers, ranging from fish bones to a chicken cage at the bottom) No! My perfect cake! Mr. Delivery guy, come back! (Candace runs past a window only to come back to see her disheveled appearance) The horror.
Phineas: Hey Candace! What do you think of our ice sculpture? We incorporated all of Aunt Tiana's and Bob's adventures. There's even a slide she can ride down to the altar.
Isabella and Ginger: (Sliding down) I do!
Candace: (Sobbing) I'm telling-- (Car honks) Mom! Maybe it's my perfect day after all! Mom! Aunt Tiana, hurry up, you've got to see this thing.
Tiana: Is she always like that?
Linda: Some days are better than others!
Candace: (Hopping up and down) It's Phineas and Ferb! They've ruined everything!
Linda: I'll go check on Lawrence and Bob.
Tiana: Candace, let's go have a look.
Candace: (Rushing to the backyard) Look at this cake, it has a chicken in it! (Chicken noise)
Tiana: Oh...
Candace: And my hair! I think it may also have a chicken in it!
Tiana: Oh my...
Candace: And this! (Gestures to the enormous ice sculpture)
Phineas: Hi, Auntie T! We're just putting the finishing touches on the scorpions. Look! The venom is sparkling apple cider!
Tiana: Oh my goodness. Candace, I- I...
Candace: Don't say it, Auntie T, I failed you! I turned your special day into the worst wedding ever!
Tiana: (In tears) But I love it.
Candace: You huh?
Tiana: I mean your hair, it's all the rage down in Montevideo. And the cake! It's like a crazy hodgepodge of everything I love. And this! Wow, all I can say is, (Hugging Candace) thank you. You planned a perfect wedding. Now why don't you come inside and help me with my dress?
Candace: Oh yay! 
(Scene switches back to DEI, Doofenshmirtz is snoring)
Doofenshmirtz: (Waking up to Perry’s chatter) Wait, what, who am I? Oh, oh, it's me! Perry the Platypus, how did you free yourself?
(Perry ties himself up with the rope, before inhaling deeply and exhaling, showing large chest muscles, before sighing)
Doofenshmirtz: Wow. But it's too late! While I was napping, enough grease dripped off my face to fill the Junk Food-inator. Nothing can stop me now! Hoo, I gotta sit down.
(The Junk Food-Inator shoots out, and hits the ice sculpture, melting it down to a small statue of Bob and Tiana and makes a snow like scenery. The ice scorpion is blasted towards DEI)
Doofenshmirtz: What the--? (Scorpion collides into the -Inator) Suddenly I feel like a glass of apple cider. I don't know how you did that, but get ready to pay, Perry the Platypus! (Stomach growls) Uh, can you hold on one second? (Goes to washroom; toilet flushes) Okay, here we are, let's do this-- (Stomach growls) Uh, uh, you know, just hold on. (Door closes) Ah you know Perry the Platypus, uh, you can just let yourself out. I...I may be a while. 
(Scene switches back to the Flynn-Fletcher household, where snow is falling)
Candace: (offscreen) Are you ready, Aunt Tiana?
Tiana: Wow, you even made it snow! Wait, what about the ice sculpture with all our great adventures?
Ferb: They say, the step you're about to take is the beginning of your greatest adventure yet.
Phineas: Little corny there, bro.
Ferb: Just (Picking up guitar) teeing up the song.
Phineas: Oh, yeah!

(Another pause)
Candace: Ugh, nuts! Ugh, just give me a minute. (Walks away and dials phone) 
(Scene opens up in the backyard at the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Isabella: Okay, the camera's all ready!
Phineas: We're almost finished with our exact replica of the Temple of Angkor Wat, constructed entirely out of playing cards. Hey, where's Candace? I bet she'd love to see this. 
(Scene shifts to Candace's room)
Candace: "Does He Think You're Pretty Enough? Ten Ways You Could Be.. Better." Wow. Ten ways? Thank you Quazmo Magazine. (cell phone rings) Jeremy!
Jeremy: Hey, Candace. Umm, so listen. I'm really sorry, but something's come up and I won't be able to make it to our date tonight. I hope you understand. Hello? ...Candace, are you there? ...Hello?...Helloo? Well, I guess we got cut off.
Candace: He just broke our date and hung up on me. Oh, it's probably not as bad as I think. Let's see what Quazmo has to say about it. (Starts blubbering) 
Phineas: Last card. You do the honors, Ferb.
(Here's where Candace goes berserk.) 
Candace: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!
(Birds fly, dogs bark, seals jump into water, monkeys make noise. Tarzan look alike yells. Monkeys stare at him)
Tarzan look alike: What? 
(Cards fall down)
Phineas: Umm, hey, Candace. Everything okay?
Candace: Beat it, dweebs! I'm having a crisis!
Phineas: Sounds like Candace is in a serious funk. I wonder what we can do to snap her out of it?
Isabella: Ooh, I know! It's all right here in Tween Bleep magazine. "Three Sure-Fire Ways to Lift Your Friend Out of a Serious Funk. Number one: Give her a complete make-over. A completely different look will often do the trick."
Phineas: A completely different look? Come on, Ferb. We need somebody who's good with make-up and fancy hair-dos.
Isabella: Umm, okay. I'll just stay here with my "Expert Makeover" patches and... Hey, where's Perry? 
(Perry robot walks over to a dog house, opens a false door, and walks into his lair. Two large animals with fedoras stand behind him.)
Major Monogram: Agent P, uuh, well, due to your...reprehensible behavior over the past few days, (screen changes to Perry robot kicking over a trash can) which I can barely believe is even possible (changes to fake Perry stealing cash out of a truck) from an agent of your caliber, (changes to fake him throwing money out the window of a car, then to him eating cereal at his host family's table but that Doofenshmirtz's home and Doofenshmirtz's table) who has learned nothing but the best in his field I, uhh, uh, actually, I don't know what's particularly bad about this clip here, but, we have no choice but...
Carl: Why? Why'd you do it?
Major Monogram: Not yet, Carl. Wait till I'm done here. (to Perry) You are officially.. discharged. (to Carl) Okay, now, Carl.
Carl: Why? Why'd you do it?
Major Monogram: Cuff him, boys.
(Perry pulls hands back, presses a button, and then flies to the back of his lair.)
Major Monogram: Red alert! Red alert! Renegade agent on the run!
(Agents chase Perry, a duck carries a chair with him.) 
(Candace presses button on her phone.)
Stacy: Hello?
Candace: Stacy, Jeremy has, like, totally lost interest in me!
Stacy: What makes you think so?
Candace: Quazmo magazine!
Stacy: I'll be right there.
(Knocking on door)
Candace: Well, that was almost impossibly fast.
(Clown arrives, walks into Candace's room)
Candace: Woah, woah, wait! You're not Stacy! Hey, hey, hey! What is going on? Huh? (Clown pulls out a pie) Uh, wait a minute. Now, don't try anything funny! (Pie splashes in her face)
Stacy: So, are you ready for some cheering up?
Candace: (looks in mirror) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Birds fly, dogs bark, seals jump in water, monkeys beat up Tarzan look-alike.) 
(Horn sound)
Phineas: No biggie, Shlocko, you gave it your best shot.
(Horn)
Phineas: In hindsight, a clown may not have been the best choice to do a makeover.
Isabella: Ya think?
Phineas: So, what else does the magazine say?
Isabella: "Step number two: Make her laugh. Laughter is the best medicine."
Phineas: Sure! Make her laugh. Candace has a great sense of humor. Remember that time she got her face caught in the sink? 
Stacy: Okay, how 'bout now we get you some ice cream?
Candace: I don't know, Stacy.
Phineas: Good afternoon, ladies.
Stacy: Or we can do this.
Phineas: We have a table reserved for you close to the stage, Miss Flynn.
Stacy: Oh. This is SO cool.
Phineas: (On microphone) Hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody! We havin' fun yet? First up, our favorite math-formula funny man, Baljeet!
(crowd applauds)
Baljeet: (Holding a plastic dummy that looks just like him) Thank you. Thanking you much. So little Jeet, I hear you went to New Delhi. And did you try the chicken club?
(odd silence)
Little Jeet: Wow, that's really what you're going with? You know, just do the water drinking bit.
Baljeet: Okay. The Pythagorean theorem...
Little Jeet: The square of the hypotenuse of a right triang... (coughs then head falls off, then Baljeet coughs)
Phineas: Let's hear it for the dummy! And that puppet wasn't bad either.
(Rim shot)
Phineas: Next up, my favorite vegetable-based comic, Broccoli Top!
Buford: I'm gonna do some prop comedy for you, and you're gonna like it! Okay, what have we got? (reaches into the box and gets a house) Here's a...here's a house. For, uh...I don't know. A mouse or something. (drops and breaks house; gets a book from his box) Here's a book. Hey, what am I...what am I supposed to do? Read? (throws book) Next! All right, let's see what else we've got! Um, and here's, uh, um... (gets out an oyster shell) An oyster shell, look! My...my mom went to a seafood restaurant...I don't have any...it's just...to me, it's just interesting. I'll put that one back in the box. (puts shell back in box) What else we got? Oh, here we go. Look! (pulls out Baljeet) A nerd to go with the book!
Baljeet: I am in both acts.
Buford: (throws Baljeet off stage and onto Ferb's drum set) Thank you! Buford's still in the building!
(crowd booing)
Candace: This isn't making me feel any better.
Buford: What? You wanna wrestle?
Phineas: Coming up next, Ferb Fletcher!
(crowd applauding)
Ferb: Ahem. So, how about that airline food?
(everybody laughs hysterically, one guy flips his table)
Candace: (not laughing along) This, is making me feel worse.
Stacy: (still laughing along) Ahahaha, what's airline food?
Phineas: (Worried) Doesn't look like it's working. 
(Scene shifts back to Isabella)
Phineas: So, what does it say for step number three?
(Isabella looks through Tween Bleep until she comes to step number three)
Isabella: It says... "Introduce her to someone new."
Phineas: That should be easy. There are lots of nice people in Danville she's never met. Ferb, I've got an idea. 
(Perry's watching one of his lookalikes carry a garbage bag into Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated. He then climbs to the top of the building to find Dr. Doofenshmirtz with Perry lookalikes.)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey fellas! Look who decided to make an appearance. (to Perry) You see, it occurred to me that what I really should be doing is fighting fire with fire. And by fire, I mean Perry the Platypus. And by fire, I ALSO mean Perry the Platypus. It occurred to me while I was on fire. I made a bunch of doppelgangers to discredit and totally destroy you. Behold the Plata-Proliferator-inator!
(Shows his invention, a clone of Perry comes out; Doofenshmirtz points to different platypuses.)
Doofenshmirtz: Meet Terry the Platypus, and say hello to Larry the Platypus, and say aloha to Jerry the Platypus. (shows distorted Perry lookalike) Yeah, he was the first one out of the batch, but you know, he was so cute, I couldn't bear to...(Jerry hits Doofenshmirtz with the pipe he was drooling on) Ow! Ow! No, no Jerry you cannot hit people, you do not... (Jerry hits him again) No, use your words Jerry. (talks to the Perry lookalikes) Anyway, all you guys, go get him!
(Perry grabs a pipe and starts swinging it around. He takes out a couple of the Perry lookalikes, then is wrestled to the ground by six of them. Camera pans to Doofenshmirtz and Jerry sitting with some popcorn, watching.)
Doofenshmirtz: Yes!
(Perry pushes all of the lookalikes off of him)
Doofenshmirtz: Awwwww. 
(Candace is seen walking home, while talking to Stacy)
Candace: Look at this, Stacy, he won't even answer his cell phone.
Little Jeet: Excuse me, Miss Flynn? You and a guest are cordially invited to the Mixer Mingler.
Candace: Mixer Mingler? Say, aren't you that dummy from the night club?
(Baljeet and his dummy look at each other)
Little Jeet: She's talking to you.
Candace: It's obviously some lame attempt from my brothers to cheer me up. I'm not going.
(Stacy pushes Candace towards the Mix 'n' Mingler)
Stacy: Come on; it will do you good.
Candace: (as they climb up the machine) Oh, would you look at this? If I wasn't so depressed, my brothers would be so busted! 
(Scene shifts to Phineas and Ferb)
Phineas: With the Mix 'n' Mingler, you'll meet someone new every two seconds. Now, let's fire this thing up.
(Phineas gets to the top of the machine)
Phineas: Fasten your seatbelts!
Candace: I can't believe I'm doing... (The machine starts spinning) AHHHHH!

(Perry is still fighting his lookalikes. He jumps onto the lawn chair Jerry was on and flings him towards the Plata-Proliferator-inator. Jerry hits the reverse button, and all of the lookalikes are sucked in. Perry also jumps on Doofenshmirtz's chair, flinging him towards the machine, which then overloads the machine, causing it to explode.)
Doofenshmirtz: Curse you, Perry the Platypus! 
(Pieces of the Plata-Proliferator-inator fall towards the Mix 'n' Mingler machine. Ferb grabs a hard hat and runs down the stairs. The Mix 'n' Mingler goes to full speed and lifts off the ground.)
Phineas: Sorry, folks. Prepare for emergency ejection. ('pulls a cord)
(People are ejected out from the machine, screaming. Phineas's chair ejects via a spring, parachutes comes out of all the chairs, and then the Mix 'n' Mingler flies away.)
Phineas: In hindsight, a simple ice cream cone might have been more effective.
Stacy: See?

Stacy: You know, a little ice cream always makes me feel better.
Candace: Maybe you're right. I'll have two scoops of...Jeremy? (Jeremy turns around) Jeremy!
Jeremy: Hey, Candace.
Candace: What are you doing here?
Jeremy: I didn't wanna break our date. I just wanted to earn some extra money, so I could surprise you.
Candace: A surprise, for me? Oh, Jeremy. 
(Scene shifts to Candace and Jeremy on their date, riding in a carriage.)
Candace: Oh, Jeremy! This was so worth the wait.
Jeremy: I'm just glad you're not one of those people who freaks out just because someone cancels a date.
Candace: (laughs awkwardly; tosses magazine over her shoulder) Right. 
(Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house, and a sunrise behind it.)
(Gurgling)
Phineas: Ferb, what's that noise? (Gurgling continues) Is that your stomach?
(Ferb nods his head twice)
Phineas: Yeah, I'm hungry, too. That trendy restaurant Mom and Dad took us to last night wasn't exactly satisfying.
(Flashback)
Phineas: Dad, can I borrow your glasses? I can't see my entrée. You know, because it's so small.
Lawrence: Yes, I think we got that.
(End flashback)
Phineas: How hard is it to have a trendy restaurant that's fun to go to, and has great food? That's it. I know what we're gonna do today, Ferb.

Candace: (Phone rings) S'up, Stace?
Stacy: Candace, are you sitting down? I don't want you to have an aneurism.
Candace: Why would I have an aneurism?
Stacy: 'Cause someone just IM'd me that someone else heard someone else overhear that Jeremy is gonna call you and ask you out for a special evening tonight! (Both squeal) Candace, do you need medical attention?
Candace: Oh. I need attention... from the doctor of love!
Stacy: Paging Dr. Jeremy.
Candace: Doctor, I got a fever.
Stacy: (Deep voice) Well, let me take care of that, little lady.
(Both laugh)
Candace: Wow, a special evening. (Phone beeps) It's my call waiting.

Candace: Uh, it wasn't him.
Stacy: Don't worry, he'll call.

Isabella: Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin'?
Phineas: Ferb and I decided to build a restaurant. Hey, you could be our hostess!
Isabella: Hmm. What'cha eatin'?
Phineas: You guys can bus tables. Baljeet can be our soda jerk.
Baljeet: I make a mean milkshake!
Phineas: Ferb will be our chef.
Buford: Hey, I can work the velvet rope. (holds it out) I never leave home without my velvet rope.
Phineas: Uh... where do you keep that?
Buford: I'll never tell.
Isabella: So, what's the name of your restaurant?
Phineas: Chez Platypus, of course! By the way, where's Perry? 
(Scene shifts to Perry's lair. Monogram is on his cell phone, trying to get a reservation at a restaurant.)
Major Monogram: What? Nothing available for tonight? Oh, never mind. (To Perry) Er, sorry, Agent P. It's date night tonight with the wife, and if I don't figure out something special to do, I'm royally in the doghouse.
Carl: Rreow! Pkshh!
Major Monogram: Carl! Anyway, Agent P, sources indicate Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to one of his evil schemes. I need you to get out there and put a stop to it. Good luck.

You're really trapped in here, just... Just like I planned, obviously. So let me tell you my latest scheme. I'm so tired of all these happy couples around me, romantic and laughing, mocking me with their happiness. Well, not anymore. My De Love-inator satellite will eliminate the feeling of love in the entire Tri-State Area. All I have to do is press this button. It would be so easy to press it right now. It would be so simple, but, you know, I've got a date tonight, and I like to stay optimistic. But if we don't hit it off, I'm definitely gonna ruin it for everyone else.
(Elevator dings; Door slamming on floor) 
(Scene shifts to the Flynn Fletcher house.)
(Jazzy piano)
Candace: Hi.
Jeremy: Hi. Ready?
Candace: I'm, like, so looking forward to tonight. A special evening, just the two of us. So, what do you have planned? Horseback riding? I just love horseback riding. Oh, you stopped.
Jeremy: Ta-da! Your brothers have opened the trendiest restaurant in town, and this is where I'm taking you.
Candace: Oh. Uh, really? Heh. How... fun.
Jeremy: Well, i-if you prefer to do something else...
Candace: Well...
Woman: Platypus-themed restaurants are so now, so wow. It will be a miracle if we get in.
Man: Cool.
Candace: Let's definitely eat here. But no way are we waiting in this line. I practically own the place. (To other people in line) Come on! Outta my way, people! VIP coming through! (To Buford) All right, Buford, make with the rope and let us in.
Buford: Name?
Candace: It's me.
Buford: "Me" who?
Candace: I'm Candace. Candace Flynn?
Buford: You're not on the list. You should have made a reservation yesterday.
Candace: This restaurant didn't exist yesterday. I demand to be let in right now.
Buford: Good evening, sir.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, I forgot to make a reservation.
Buford: No problem, dude.
Candace: Did that guy just bribe you?
Buford: He didn't bribe me. He just caught my attention in a monetary fashion. Now, back in line. 
(Inside Chez Platypus...)
Isabella: Right this way to your table, sir.
Phineas: Hey, Isabella. Have you seen Perry?
Isabella: No, not lately.
Phineas: Hmm. 
Doofenshmirtz: So I noticed in your online profile that you say you like tall men. Is--? Is--? Is that true?
Doofenshmirtz's date: That's right. And you're not very tall at all.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, I-I'm 6'2". I slouch.
Doofenshmirtz's date: My last date was 6'9". Now, that's a good-looking man. But I'll be honest, I've never been able to resist a man in a lab coat.
Doofenshmirtz: (Gasps) Really? Look. Look, I'm wearing one right now. 
Phineas: Hey. There you are, Perry. We've gotta put you in your place of honor. 
Doofenshmirtz's date: I'm usually extremely attracted to blonds.
Doofenshmirtz: I-I see.
Doofenshmirtz's date: But there is something about your windblown style that gives me goose bumps.
Doofenshmirtz: Really? Well, I-I must say, it's quite a bit of work in the morning, you know, but apparently worth it. 
Phineas: There you go, Perry. Now everyone can see you.
(Song: "Quirky Worky Song")
Phineas: Hey, Ferb. We need a chicken special for table five.
(Squeals) 
Buford: Enjoy your meal.
Candace: Really. You're letting complete strangers in. I'm the owners' sister. I demand to be let in right now! I'm supposed to be having the time of my life!
Jeremy: Candace? I really don't mind waiting a bit. It's actually kinda fun just hanging out here with you.
Candace: Oh, really?
Buford: All right, next party, step this way.
Candace: Oh, come on! 
Doofenshmirtz: So, how do you feel about evil?
Doofenshmirtz's date: Huh? That's a weird question.
Doofenshmirtz: Is it? I-I'm just making conversation.
Doofenshmirtz's date: But I love it. Look.
Doofenshmirtz: You have an evil tattoo. Look, look, look, just like mine.
Doofenshmirtz's date: I can't believe we have so much in common. Y-you know, I don't even put "evil" on my profile anymore because it attracts so many weirdos.
Doofenshmirtz: Don't I know it. 
Candace: That's it. I'm calling Mom and making her tell the boys to let us in. (To Linda) Mom, Phineas and Ferb made an exclusive restaurant in the yard and you've got to tell them to tell Buford to let us in.
Linda: Okay, okay, honey. We're just finishing dinner. We'll be home in a minute.
Candace: Argh! (At Jeremy) Jeremy, hold our place in line. I'm going out front to wait for my Mom.
Jeremy: But Candace... 
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus? Oh, looking for my remote, are you? Well, here. Take it. I don't need it anymore. I am in love!
Woman: Sven, I heard a trendy new badger restaurant just opened up the street.
Man: Cool.
People: Ooh, badger restaurant./I love badgers.
Woman: Platypus-themed restaurants are so four hours ago. Let's bail.
Man: Cool.
Boy: I haven't eaten badger in a week.
(Crowd chattering)
Ferb: Ah, the public is fickle.
TV Host: Excuse me, young man. I'd like to buy your restaurant. I envision a chain of platypus-themed restaurants as far as the Tri-State Area can see.
Phineas: Heck, dinner service is over. You can have it. 
(Perry smashes the remote, which causes the satellite to fall towards Earth.) 
Candace: Mom, Dad, the boys have a restaurant in the yard, and they're not letting me in. You've gotta put a stop to it! Come on!
Jeremy: Goodbye!
Phineas: Have fun with the restaurant!
Candace: Uh, guys? Ugh, whatever.
Jeremy: Excuse me, miss. Do you have a table for two?
Isabella: (Giggles) Right this way, sir.
(Piano)
Baljeet: Enjoy.
Jeremy: You know, Candace, I've had a lot of fun in your backyard, but this is the best time yet.
(Candace giggles)
Linda: Oh, look. How adorable! (To Candace) Candace, you want me to put a stop to this?
Candace: No! No, no, no! Go! Shoo! Keep moving, nothing to see here. (To Jeremy) Now, where were we?

(Scene opens up showing a front view of the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Candace: As president of the Healthy Dessert Club, I declare that nothing says low-calorie, non-fat more than gelatin.
Stacy: You wouldn't have started this club because gelatin is Jeremy's favorite dessert, would you?
Candace: What? No!
(Perry chatters)
Candace: Ew! Gross! Phineas and Ferb! Your smelly rodent pet is germing up the cabinets! Where are those two?
(Phineas and Ferb appear behind Candace)
Phineas: Right here, Candace.
Candace: But how? How did you get there? How did you get where you are so fast?
Phineas: Oh, we're just putting the finishing touches on our molecular transporter. Would you like to try?
Candace: Do I look like someone who wants their moleculars transported? Now get that stinky pet out of our cabinets and go scramble your molecules somewhere else!
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry. (To Candace) Bye, Candace!
(They begin teleporting away)
Jenny: Would you guys like to try some of our gelatin?
Phineas: Okay!
(They stop teleporting)
Candace: No, wait! They'll just end up doing something weird and ruin the party!
Jenny: How is sharing gelatin with them gonna ruin the party?
Candace: (Eye twitches) Some... how?
Stacy: You want cherry or grape?
Phineas: Grape, please.
Candace: No, wait.
(Phineas and Ferb eat some of the gelatin as Candace watches on in horror)
Phineas: Thanks, guys.
Candace: Well, I guess that wasn't too weird.
(Phineas and Ferb begin bouncing the gelatin)
Phineas: It's as fun to eat as the crazy, fun things you can do with it.
Ferb: The cartilaginous fibers from the bovine patella structure, that gelatin's extracted from, gives it that fun, bouncy quality.
Candace: What did I tell you? Weird. Now, let the professional handle this before it gets out of hand. Why don't you make your own gelatin and leave us alone?
Phineas: Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.
Candace: Wait! I'm not finished!
Phineas: Bye, Candace.
Candace: Stay away from me and my friends and my gelatin that I don't want ruined with your ruiny ruinness. Hm. (To Stacy and Jenny) What? 
Phineas: Hey, Isabella. Thanks for letting us use your pool as the largest gelatin mold ever.
Isabella: You bet.
Phineas: Ferb, release the gelatin mix.
Baljeet: Ooh, ooh, ooh, may I add some of my favorite flavor?
Phineas: Sure, buddy.
Baljeet: (He pours in his favorite flavor) Hah-hah!
Phineas: (On megaphone) Stirring team, commence mixing operations.
Fireside Girls: Aye, aye!
(The kids go around the pool in paddles boats, mixing the gelatin)
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?
(Perry hops down a flower pot on a poolside table)
Wanda Acronym: Ah, Agent P, glad you're here. Professor Poofenplotz has replaced all the fine handbags in the Tri-State area– Good grief! Perry the Platypus, what are you doing here? Your lair is across the street. Good day to you, sir.
(Perry is sucked out a tube, and Pinky the Chihuahua replaces him)
Wanda Acronym: Ah. Agent Pinky, finally. 
Major Monogram: Ah, there you are, Agent P. I hear you took a wrong tube and ended up over in Wanda's division. Well, Doofenshmirtz has sent you a video message. Take a look.
Doofenshmirtz: (On video) Thanks Monogram. Oh, hello, Perry the Platypus. I'm sure you're getting this. I– I was hoping you would stop by today for some tea. See, I've got all these little tea things set out and ready and, um... Uh, please use the front entrance, Perry the Platypus, because– Uh, because, uh, all the other entrances don't work today. So its back to you monogram. bye-bye. I'll see you later today! Coming in through the front entrance.
Major Monogram: So you see, Doofenshmirtz has invited you to tea. We don't know what it could possibly mean. We think– But don't hold us to this. We think that maybe, just maybe, it could be a trap. We do, however, like to give people the benefit of the doubt, uh, so try to have fun. Monogram out.

Phineas: Looks good. And judging by my chronometer here, it should be just about time. There's only one thing to do now.
Baljeet: You mean test the resiliency of our cartilaginous collusion with vigorous application of weight and velocity?
Phineas: Exactly. Let's jump on it.
(All cheering)
Candace: And now for the themed gelatin sculpture part of our get-together. Stacy.
Stacy: I made a pair of shoes. You know, 'cause I like shoes.
Candace: Nicely done. And how about yours, Jenny?
Jenny: Well, I fashioned this dove to symbolize my desire for world peace and a true—
Candace: Yeah, yeah. Get a load of my entry. It's Jeremy's head.

Jenny: Hey, what's that?
Stacy: Sounds like fun.
Candace: What?
Stacy: That looks awesome.
Jenny: We should go over there and check it out.
Stacy: Totally.
Candace: But that's just Phineas and Ferb and their friends.
Jenny: Don't be so uptight.

♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated ♪
Doofenshmirtz: This is nice, huh? You know, I was thinking the other day about how much better you would be as an ally. So I created this. I call it my Turn-Everything-Evil-Inator. Now, you just sit still. Okay, great. You know, after I turn you evil, we can use it to create a whole army of evil minions. Won't that be fun? Hold still. (Doofenshmirtz fires his -inator at Perry, while Perry dodges the rays) Hey. I'm beginning to think you don't want to be allies at all. I'm not trying to make it personal! 
(One of the stray rays hits the giant pool of Gelatin, turning it into a gelatin monster)
Gelatin Monster: Evil!
Phineas: Who added the evil flavor?
(Everybody looks at Baljeet)
Baljeet: It's curry. It's not inherently evil. Maybe a little spicy.
(The Gelatin Monster roars)
Baljeet: Okay, I'm going home.
Candace: What the–?
(Gelatin Monster roars)
Candace: Wait till Mom sees this!
(Gelatin Monster eats Candace, the roars)
Candace: (Muffled from inside the gelatin monster) You guys are so busted!
Phineas: Well, I guess we gotta rescue Candace.
Holly: But do we fight a gelatin monster?

Gelatin Monster: (Growling) Master.
(The Gelatin Monster climbs up Doofenshmirtz's building, and enters his lair)'
Doofenshmirtz: Aha, a gelatin monster. I knew there was going to be something fun. Get him! Now you can bow down before my cartilaginous creation. It's so corrupt and cantankerous and carnivorous and, uh... Uh, low in calories and ca– Ca– Cow– Couch. Hm. Ah, that's all I got.

(In the Garcia-Sahpiro backyard)
Linda: Oh, there's everyone. Candace, I thought you were having your dessert party today? What are you doing at Isabella's?
Candace: I got two words for you, Mom. Gel-a-tin. I am sick of it! Sick of it! Totally sick of it! (Snorts)
Jeremy: Hey, Candace, I heard you were having a dessert party, so I made you this out of gelatin.
(He reveals Candace's name, made from gelatin)
Candace: Aw. Nah, I'm still sick of it. 
(The scene opens with the Flynn-Fletcher house in view, then cuts to Candace's room)
Candace: Okay, Stacy. We've got about ten minutes until Jeremy's party, so you've gotta help me decide. Should I go with this swimsuit or this swimsuit? (Pulls out two swimsuits, only very slightly different colors)
Stacy: Hmm, that's tough. One on hand, if you go with the achromatic pink, it kinda says "Hi, I'm Candace, and I'm bedraggled and pallid". Trust me, you don't want that. I've been both. But, if you go with the more saturated pink, it kinda gives you that "overkill, out-to-kill, my currency is urgency" look.
Candace: I don't want that. I've been all three.
Stacy: Let your subconscious do the deciding. Go with the one you touched first.
Candace: Of course! Stacy, you're a fashion phenom.
Stacy: (Holding a sunflower hat and a fez) Which hat should I go with?
Candace: I don't think it matters.
Stacy: Yeah, you're right, I fuss too much. 
(Cut to the living room)
Phineas: (Eating breakfast) Nothing starts off a day better than some breakfast and some education.
TV announcer: (On television) We now return to "Wacky Millionaires Throughout History". Howard Hughes is probably best known for building the Spruce Goose, so-called because of its wooden frame. With a wingspan of 319 feet 11 inches, it still holds the record for being the largest plane ever built.
Phineas: Wow, that's an impressive record. 319 feet 11 inches is just over the length of a football field, and only one afternoon away from being broken. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!
(Ferb is shown wearing a mustache and a hair-style like Howard Hughes as he gives a thumbs up.)
(Cut to the backyard, where Phineas and Ferb are working on the plane.)
Isabella: Hey guys. Whatcha doin?
Phineas: We're makin' the biggest airplane ever!
Isabella: Cool! Coincidentally, we're going for our aeronautics patches.
Phineas: Coincidentally, we could use extra hands.
Isabella: Coincidentally, we're in.
Phineas: We're making our plane out of paper mache with newspaper!
Isabella: Why? To make sure it's newsworthy?
Phineas: (Gang laughs) And red all over!
Buford: (Gang laughs) Oh! Oh, oh, hah, and funny! (Everyone stares at him blankly) Hahahahaha! And funny! You know, 'cause, 'cause, the funnies! Hehe...
Phineas: But seriously, Howard Hughes called his plane the Spruce Goose, 'cause it was made of wood. So, we're gonna call ours "The Paper Pelican", 'cause it's made of newspaper! You know, so it will have a good circulation!
(Gang laughs)
Buford: Aw, come on!
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry? 
(Agent P runs over to a flower bed, pushes a flower down, and lands in his seat)
Major Monogram: Ah, Agent P. We just discovered Doofenshmirtz has been stealing bottles from recycling bins, and nothing good can come from that. (Photo of Doofenshmirtz digging through trash cans appears on the monitor) Unless, of course, he's recycling, in which case nothing but good can come from that. Unless, he's recycling it into some hideous weapon, which is something once again no good could come from. Except, of course, for the recycling part, which I guess is still at its essence, good. Even if you're making something evil, it's still reducing the... You know, you know, perhaps we shouldn't even put these good and evil labels on things. Let's just say Doofenshmirtz is doing something neutral. So, just get out there and make sure it stays like that. (Agent P disappears)

Doofenshmirtz: (The wall flips and Agent P appears) Perry the Platypus? (phone rings) Hello? It's for you, Perry the Platypus. (He ties the phone cord around Agent P) Haha, prank call! Now say hello to my new evil weapon: My Evaporator-inator! It's made completely out of recycled materials. It's green... (takes off lab coat to show a recycling sign and "greevil" letters on it in green) ...and evil! I call it, "Greevil." (laughs) Backstory time! You see Perry the Platypus when I was a young boy, my mother would never let me swim in public pools.

Candace: Who's that Jeremy's talking to?
Stacy: I have no idea. I've never seen her before in my life.
Candace: I thought Jeremy invited me to this party.
Stacy: Let's not jump to conclusions yet. (both crawl under everyone and pop up from behind a chair)
Candace: What is Jeremy doing with her?
Stacy: Slow down. Remember how you thought Jeremy was with a girl and she wasn't even a she? And then you ended up on that snowboard all out of control?
Candace: Yeah, but she's obviously a real girl.
Nicolette: So then I got two west African pit vipers, and had to dive off a 300-foot cliff, and swim-up through a school of piranha.
Jeremy: That's awesome, Nicolette.
Candace: Stacy, it's conclusion-jumping-to-time. Strategy session, now! (both hide in bushes) She's amazing! She's all exotic and stuff! She has on the same bathing suit as me, only it's brighter and she wears it better. And she dives off cliffs holding poisonous snakes into piranha-infested water! What am I going to do? She's like catnip for boys! She's boynip! 
(At the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Phineas: Nicely done, people. Hey, Baljeet, what are the stats on the Spruce Goose again?
Baljeet: The Spruce Goose's wingspan is 319 feet 11 inches.

Baljeet: 320 feet even!
Phineas: Eat your heart out, Howard Hughes.
(Isabella and Baljeet as flight attendants direct everyone inside)
Isabella and Baljeet: Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard.
Buford: You'd better have some decent grub on this bucket.
Baljeet: You will be most gratified. (Buford walks in) As long as you find insignificant bags of peanuts gratifying... (slaps himself) Welcome to Wedgieville. Population: me.

Phineas: All right, Ferb. Let's go through our pre-flight checklist. Pilots instruments? Check. Copilot's instruments?
Ferb: Check.
Phineas: Looks like everything's a go, Ferb. Let's switch her on. Ignition! (pushes a button and the Paper Pelican starts to fly) Adjust angle of departure, check. (Paper Pelican flies off) We've reached cruising altitude. You are now free to move about the cabin.
Isabella: Would you like some peanuts?
Katie: I'll take two packs, please.
Buford: That'd better not be insignificant bags of peanuts.
Baljeet: No! Of course not, sir. (walks off; comes back with a chicken-shaped out of peanuts) Here, sir. Try our deluxe peanut chicken. Our motto is: "So peanutty, you will not even taste the chicken!"

Nicolette: I didn't say anything about sulfuric acid.
Candace: Leave all questions to the end of the rant? Thank you. 
Doofenshmirtz: Now, say "goodbye" to splashy-pool time fun, forever! Even my power source is greevil. It's solar! Do you mind Perry the Platypus, this is really a two-handed job. (He hangs the phone up on Perry. A panel in the floor rotates Perry to a potted plant, then back to Perry, now free) Ah! Seriously- (Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz in the face, knocking his into his -inator, and firing it in an unintended direction) 
Candace: Now, as I was saying before I was so lamely interrupted, I'm going to show everybody a real dare-devil dive. (The Beam from Doofenshmirtz's -inator hits the pool, evaporating it)

Guy: Safety first! (He puts a helmet on Candace)

Doofenshmirtz: That was your last highly-improbable judo maneuver Perry the Platypus. I will now evaporate-innate you into non-existence! (The Paper Pelican flies by covering the sun)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh no! my-my power source! Oh, great now I can't see a thing!
(Perry runs and kicks Doofenshmirtz off the building)
Doofenshmirtz: Curse you Perry the Platypus. 
Stacy: WooHoo! Yeah! Go Candace!
Candace: (As she continues to skateboard out of control) Help me! (The Paper Pelican covers up the sun, turning everything dark) I can't see!
Jeremy: Candace?
(Candace crashes into Jeremy)
(People talk among themselves about the crash) 
Phineas: This is your captain speaking; we're beginning our descent.
Baljeet: Okay, everyone. Please return your seats to their upright positions, and please do not panic. As you can see the Paper Pelican is dissolving in water, because it is, after all, made of paper mache. But do not worry, because your seat cushions also function as flotation devices. Thank you for flying with us.
(A panel flips, and Perry appears next to Phineas and Ferb in a seat)
Phineas: Oh, there you are Perry. 
(Scene opens up showing a Teen Preen magazine.)
Stacy: "Boys are human beings too. (Camera rotates, showing Stacy holding the magazine.) If you're interested in one of them, make them feel comfortable by asking him questions about himself." Okay, they lost me at the "boys/human beings" thing.
(Candace growls)
Stacy: Candace, this article specifically says not to growl psychotically. It makes boys feel uncomfortable.
Candace: Look at them down there. Planning something. Oh, I'm gonna bust them today for sure.
Stacy: That's what you say everyday.
Candace: Well, that's because they build something everyday. Seems like every time I get Mom and I'm ready to bust, their stupid invention disappears.
Stacy: Candace, looks to me like you're going about this the wrong way. Don't focus on the boys; focus on the invention. If you can find out where the stuff goes, maybe you can take your Mom there and she'd finally see the evidence.
Candace: Yeah! Stacy, you're a genius!
Stacy: Wow, go figure! Would you call my mom and tell her that? 
(Scene switches to the Flynn-Fletcher backyard)
Candace: Hey, Phineas!
Phineas: Yo.
Candace: Uh, you know how you guys, like, build stuff everyday?
Phineas: Yeah?
Candace: And you know how you make it disappear at the end of the day?
Phineas: No.
Candace: And-- What do you mean "No"?
Phineas: We don't make it disappear.
Candace: (Scoffs) Well, then where does it go?
Phineas: We don't know what happens to it, but it helps with cleanup. And Ferb here says to never look a gift horse in a mouth.
(Ferb nods)
Candace: So you're telling me you're not even a slightest bit curious as to where the thing goes?
(Ferb turns his head at Phineas)
Phineas: Yeah, I guess we're a little bit curious. Hmm... Why don't Ferb and I build something and you guys keep your eyes on it? Maybe you can find out where the thing goes.
Candace: Sounds like a plan! (At Stacy) A plan of busting! (They high-5, at Phineas) All right boys, make it big and make it obvious. 
(Scene switches to a sign saying "Big and Obvious construction site". As the boys work the camera pans to Candace and Stacy sitting in lounge chairs.)
Candace: Now remember, we can't take our eyes off of this for even a second.
Stacy: What if I need to blink?
Candace: Here! (Pulls out an aerosol can) Use this! Saline solution.
(Ferb's blow torch fizzing)
Phineas: Hey, (Opens Ferb's welding mask) where's Perry? 
(Behind Candace and Stacy, Perry comes out of Candace's recliner. He tiptoes past it, and an elevator emerges from the grass. It dings, and it's lights flash randomly. Perry looks back to see if Candace and Stacy would look, then runs into the elevator, and it's door closes. The elevator lands in Perry's lair.)
Major Monogram: What do you think, too much? Oh, I'm just getting into the mood. I'm going to Vegas this weekend. (Pause) Okay. (Takes a sheet) Our sources tell us that Doofenshmirtz is working on an invisibility ray, and that can't be good. Get out there and put a stop to it. (Perry runs off) And may luck be with you! Lady luck, baby! Hot-cha. 
(Scene switches back to the Flynn-Fletcher backyard; A sign reads, "Coming soon, Big Obvious Ride". Isabella enters.)
Isabella: Hey Phineas. Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: We're just building a big and obvious ride in our backyard!
Isabella: Cool! Can I ride it?
Candace: Nobody riding anything! We're just gonna watch it.
Phineas: Candace wants to see where it goes.
Isabella: Okay...
Buford: Whoa! What is that?
Candace: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just another one of their cool rides. Just get behind us and help us watch it.
Buford: How's my schedule?
Baljeet: Well, right now you're just carrying me around like luggage.
Buford: We're in! 
(At Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc., Perry's hovercraft flies to it. Inside, Perry kicks open the door.)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus? You're just in time. (Pulls out a remote) Just in time to be trapped! (Presses the remote button. A crashing sound is heard. Perry looks around for the trap) Didn't Major Monogram tell you I was working on an invisible ray?
(Perry shrugs)
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, well, I made one, and now you're in an invisible cage. And so you don't get bored, I put in an invisible tin cup in there for you to play with.
(Perry picks up the cup and moves it back and forth)
Doofenshmirtz: Yes, see? Fun with sound. Behold, Perry the Platypus, (Presses the remote button) my Invis-inator! (The Invis-inator fires) And why would I need an Invisibility ray like this, you ask? Well, you know when those cute, little Fireside Girls come by to sell their-- Their cupcakes, or their-- Or their raffle tickets or whatever?
(Scene switches to Doofenshmirtz watching TV)
Doofenshmirtz: And you forgot to close your shades, (Gretchen and Katie walk up to the door. Gretchen knocks the door) so they come to the front door, and they could see you! (Gretchen and Katie peek through the window) They could see you, watching TV or whatever, (Doofenshmirtz sits back) and you can't pretend that you're not home (Doofenshmirtz sinks in his chair) because they can see you! And they have those big, pleading eyes making you feel guilty, and-- (Scene switches back to Doofenshmirtz) So, I'm just gonna shoot them with a ray so I don't have to look at them. 
(Scene switches back to the Flynn-Fletcher backyard. Camera pans to everyone, including the Fireside Girls looking at the ride. Candace is seen, wide-eyed, looking at the invention. Ginger's eyes are red, veiny, and she rubs them.)
Candace: Hey! No shuteye, girly.

Doofenshmirtz: You see, Perry the Platypus, the entire Tri-State Area-- (Scratching) Hey, what-- What are you doing? Is that an invisible file? You've forced my hand! I have no choice (Presses the button) but to open the trap door, (The door opens) and release the invisible tiger! (Turns around) Hmm... Uh, are you feeling any biting or scratching in there, because--
(Camera switches to Perry. Doofenshmirtz is heard being mauled by the tiger)
Doofenshmirtz: (Is seen with his coat scratched, carrying a whip and chair) Back, you tiger! Ow! Where-- Where are you? So I can snap my whip at you! (Snaps the whip twice) Get in there! Get back, get back! (Drops the whip and presses the button) In there! (The door closes) I attribute that to poor planning. (Throws away the chair) If I had the tiger door inside your cage, you would have been-- (Gets hit by Perry swinging on a rope. Doofenshmirtz rolls into the Invis-inator's ray) Now, Perry the Platypus, you can never be sure where the final strike will come from. (Perry turns around) Ah, I'm an imperceptible enigma. I move in silence-- (Perry kicks him) Ow! Oh you followed the sound of my voice, maybe I should stop talk-- (Perry punches and kicks him) Ow, ow, ow! Quit it! (He knocks down a chair and rolls into the Invis-inator's ray, causing him to become visible again) Interesting! If you're already invisible, it turns you visible again-- (Perry throws the chair at him) Ow! Oh well that came out of nowhere. 
(Scene switches back to the Flynn-Fletcher backyard)
Stacy: So, how long is this gonna take?
Candace: I mean it usually disappears as soon as the kids are done playing on it-- (Gets an idea) Oop! Wait a minute, that's it! (At the gang) You guys gotta play on it! Go! Go have fun! Go!
Phineas: Okay.
Buford: (Is seen sitting on Baljeet) Eh, my schedule's flexible.

Buford: (Laughs) WOO-HOO-HOO! OH BUFORD LOVES THIS!
Candace: That's it, laugh. Laugh while you still can. 
(Scene switches to Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.. Perry is still fighting Doofenshmirtz. Doofenshmirtz punches him, causing Perry to slide to the Invis-inator's ray, but half of his body is visible)
Doofenshmirtz: (Laughs) Look at you! You're just a bottom! (Perry punches him) Oh, it's on now! (Charges at Perry, who throws him over. Doofenshmirtz's body is now half invisible) Oop! Look at me! I'm just a top!
(Perry jumps at him. They go through the Invis-inator's ray, and now Perry's top is visible, bottom invisible, as Doofenshmirtz's bottom is visible, top invisible. They run off, and Doofenshmirtz jumps over and punches Perry. He throws him at the Invis-inator's ray, and now Perry's bottom is visible, top invisible. Perry aims the Invis-inator at Doofenshmirtz's top, which is visible. Perry's top is visible by putting is top into the Invis-inator's ray) 
(Scene switches to the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Candace: Okay, fun's fun! Now everybody, back in your seats! Now if we just keep watching it... 
(At Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc., Perry hops off the Invis-inator, causing it to aim at the Flynn-Fletcher house)

Candace: Any minute now... (Horn honks. Candace gasps) I can't believe it! Mom's home! (The Invis-inator's ray hits the ride) There's no way she's gonna miss the-- (Notices the ride disappeared. She screams) Phineas, what did you do?
Phineas: I don't... Th-th-- Think I did anything!
(Candace looks up)
Candace: Wait, it's Mom! It only happens when she comes home!
(Linda drives up)
Candace: Mom! Mom! Do me a favor and just back down the driveway a bit!
Linda: Uh, okay. (She backs away. The Invis-inator's ray is heard)
Candace: Any changes?
Phineas: It's back!
Candace: I can't believed that worked! (At Linda) Okay Mom, come back! Come back! (Linda drives back. The Invis-inator's ray hits the ride, causing it to disappear)
Phineas: It's gone again!
Isabella: Candace, how are you doing that?
Candace: Back back back back back! (Shoves the car backwards. She steps around the spot) There's gotta be some kind of sensor in the driveway! (Camera switches to Linda) But where is it? (Camera switches to Candace stepping around the spot) It's gotta be here somewhere! (Ray fires)
Kids: It's back! (Candace looks back, leaning) It's gone! (Candace leans forward) It's back! (Candace leans backward) It's gone! (Candace repeatedly leans forward and backward) Back! Gone! Back! Gone!
Linda: (Looks out the window) Candace, you obviously have some issues with the driveway. I'm just gonna park in front. (Backs away to the front of the house. The ray fires, and the ride come back)
Kids: It's back!
Candace: Wait, she can see it from the front yard! (Runs to the car) Mom!
Linda: Just a sec, honey. I'm getting my stuff.
Candace: Mom, look! (The ray fires, and the ride disappears) No!
(Back at the backyard)
Phineas: Hey Candace, it's still here! It's just invisible!
Candace: What?! (Runs to the backyard) It's still here?
Stacy: Candace, check this out!
(Candace feels the ride)
Candace: Hum... (Gasps) Paint!
Linda: (With grocery bags) Candace, where are you going?
Candace: I'll be right back! (At the garage she grabs a can of paint, then runs back) Ee-ee-ee-ee...
(Scene switches to Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.. Doofenshmirtz's control panel is seen smoking)
Doofenshmirtz: You think you've beaten me, but you haven't, 'cause I can turn the Invis-inator into a Disintegrator, with just the simple (Pushes a button. The ray prepares to fire) push of a button!
(Perry jumps. The ray fires. At the Flynn-Fletcher house. The ray hits the invisible ride. Back at Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc., Perry aims the Disintegrator at the control panel. Doofenshmirtz ducks)

Phineas: Hi Mom!
Linda: I got some--
Candace: (Running excitedly, with the can of paint) Coming through!
Linda: Candace, what are you doing?
Candace: You'll see! Everyone will see! (Cackles maniacally. She dumps the paint on the spot where the ride was, causing the paint to splat on the grass. Candace drops the paint can) I don't understand! I don't understand! (Tries to feel the ride) I just don't understand!
Linda: Candace, I have no idea what you're up to, but you're more that welcome to join us for cookies when you're done cleaning up. (At the kids) Come on kids!
Kids: Yeah!/Cool!/Go Mom!/Buford loves cookies!
Ferb: Well, we were all watching it, and Quantum Theory states that the mere observation of an experiment changes its outcome.
Candace: Now you tell me. 
Grandpa Reg: So kids, are you enjoying your visit to England?
Phineas: Oh, yes Grandpa. We even learned how to use real thatch.
Grandpa Reg: Well, thatch terrific! (he laughs with Phineas) That was a good one.
(Candace and Stacy groan)
Stacy: There's nothing to do.
Candace: Nothing for us to do.
Grandma Winifred: What? Why don't you read my old collection of Sherlock Holmes? I've got the whole collection right here.
Stacy: Gee. Thanks, Mrs. Fletcher.
Grandma Winifred: Dinner's at 1900. That's 7 o'clock for you Yanks.
Candace: Ah, yes. Reading. That's what they did before they invented fun.
Grandma Winifred: I heard that.
Candace: Well, it's better than nothing. (Both she and Stacy begin reading) Hmm? Mmm-hmm... Hmm...

Lawrence: Okay, is everybody ready? We're going to take you kids to see the London Eye.
Phineas: What's that?
Lawrence: One of our largest Ferris wheels in the entire universe.
Phineas: Cool!
Lawrence: Girls, are you ready?
Candace: Wait, wait, almost finished.
Lawrence: Candace, you stayed up all night just to finish that book?
Candace: No, no. We finished the whole collection.

Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz is up to no good here, in the UK. And, uh, after your last mission in London, we ran into some trouble with the British Spy Union. So joining you today is Agent Double 0-0. And joining me today is the lovely Inspector Initials.
(Agent Double 0-0 drops down from the ceiling and lands in the chair, whilst Inspector Initial splits the screen with Monogram)
Inspector Initials: Double 0-0, you and Agent P will be assigned the same mission against Dr. Doofenshmirtz.
Agent Double 0-0: You realize this man is a Platypus?
Inspector Initials: They're American, Double 0-0. Just be glad it's a mammal.
Major Monogram: Ooh. Rrreow. Well, go get him, Agent P.
Agent Double 0-0: What? That's it? No files? No location? No contact? What kind of a mission is this?
Major Monogram: It was enough for the mammal.
Inspector Initials: Ooh. Rrreow. 
Grandpa Reg: Alright, you lot. Have a splendid day in London. We'll be back tonight after the International Haggis Festival.
Lawrence: There's twenty-nine individual flavors!
Grandpa Reg: Cheerio.
Linda: Here are your tickets for the London Eye. You might want to get in line now, 'cause it looks pretty crowded.
(Carnival music)
Linda: We'll pick you up around 4:15. Bye, kids.
Grandma Winifred: Have fun!
All but Ferb: Bye!
Phineas: Candace, you know what? Ferb and I will meet you back here later. See ya!
Stacy: Bye, guys! (to Candace) Hey, let's go shopping!
Candace: Did you hear that? Even in England, my brothers have some scheme planned.
Stacy: How can you tell?
Candace: You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to—Ooh! Stacy, that's it! Who did we stay up learning about? (she hakes her) Who is the total king of busting?
Stacy: Sherlock Holmes?
Candace: Yes! Maybe I can finally bust the boys once and for all if I use Holmes's method of deduction! Come on. This will be fun! You could be Dr. Watson. 
(Perry and Double 0-0 sit in Perry's hover car, with Agent Double 0-0 being very cramped and setting it off balance)
Agent Double 0-0: That's it. We're taking my car.
(They drive down the streets of London in Double 0-0's car)
Agent Double 0-0: Now this is a motor car. It has pretty much everything. Radar, Subatomic Sonar, Nuclear Particle Response System, and a MP3 player. (Button beeps) Don't touch that, it's the ejector– (The seat ejects sending Double 0-0 flying out of the car, which eventually comes to a rest as Double 0-0 catches back up and retakes the driver's seat) And I suppose you think that's funny.
(Perry chatters and the car shoots off)
(Candace and Stacy walk down the street with Candace wearing a deerstalker hat and robe similar to Sherlock Holmes, and Stacy wearing a bowler hat like that of Dr. Watson)
Candace: By using Holmesian Deduction, we'll be one step ahead of the boys. We can get Mom and finally show her–
Stacy: Ooh. Shoes. (Stacy stops at a storefront)
Candace: Stacy? I need you to focus!
Stacy: Sorry, sorry. Got a little distracted there. You know, London, cool stores, shopping.
Candace: There they are! Now why are they going into an auto parts store? Alright, Watson. Here's where the deducing begins. (she gasps) They've acquired a fleet of automobiles. And they're in there buying a bunch of little air fresheners for them. Or... they're buying motor oil for their giant robot! What do you think, Stace? Stace?
Stacy: (returning with shopping bags) What? 
(At the Big Ben, Perry and Agent Double 0-0 bust in and find Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus? Oh, who's your little friend here?
Agent Double 0-0: I'm Agent Double 0-0, from Her Majesty's secret service.
Doofenshmirtz: Double 0-0? I-isn't that just triple "O"?
Agent Double 0-0: No, that's not how you say it.
Doofenshmirtz: It spells "OOO", does it?
Agent Double 0-0: It's just Double 0-0.
Doofenshmirtz: He's "P" and you're "OOO", so together you spell-
Agent Double 0-0: No, they're not "O"s, they're zeros. Alright?
Doofenshmirtz: I was just going to say "OOOP". Looks like I struck a nerve there!
(He presses a remote and two traps spring out, holding Perry around the waist, but Double 0-0 around the shins)
Agent Double 0-0: Hey!
Doofenshmirtz: I must apologize, all of my traps are platypus-sized.
Agent Double 0-0: What about this then? (he motions to a large rocket engine above them)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, that. You see, as I get older, I find it's harder and harder to read my small, little wristwatch. So, I will launch Big Ben into space, and fly it all the way to the Tri-State Area. (He demonstrates on a scale model) La-la-la, here I am, la-la-la, I just woke up and want to know what time it is – Yes! I am a genius!
Agent Double 0-0: So that– That's your whole plan?
Doofenshmirtz: Well, in a nutshell, yes. What do you think?
Agent Double 0-0: Am I on one of those hidden camera shows? You realize you could just buy a bigger watch? Or maybe a wall clock?
Doofenshmirtz: Yes, but then I would have to drive to a store, and find a parking space, then you have to choose from, like - dozens of styles, I- It just seems like so much work. This will be much less complicated. 
Candace: (upon entering the auto parts shop) Okay, Watson. Excuse me sir, were these boys in here earlier?
Worker: Well, them two bics were 'angin' about an' they got a bit o' the bushies an', uh, also ran back an' carted off some ol' bangers that ah didn' need. Oi! Aren' they a bit harrish for them kind o' bushies?
Candace: Stacy?
Stacy: (Flipping through a Cockney for tourists book) I'm working on it. Ah! He said "They were here, they carted away some junk from out back, and, aren't they a little young to be doing that?"
Candace: Yes. Yes they are. (Stacy and Candace enter the back lot) Aha! It's crawling with clues out here! Hmm... Look at these circular indentations in the dirt. (She sniffing) And the subtle scent of rubber in the air. By Jove, Stacy! What could it be?
Stacy: Uh, "Free Tires"? (She looks at a sign advertising "Free Tires")
Candace: Maybe, maybe... We need more clues!

Agent Double 0-0: Don't worry, Agent P. I'll have us out of these before you know it. (He activates a laser on his watch and begins cutting through the restraints)
Candace: There they are. (Phineas and Ferb get into a taxi that promptly pulls off) They dropped a notebook. The page is torn, but it says "To big race 1600 Water S." Water Street! The final clue! They're having a race at 1600 Water Street! Ooh, I gotta call Mom! (To her mom through the phone) And that's why you've gotta come down to 1600 Water Street. (She and Stacy arrive at 1600 Water Street which is nothing but an old abandoned building) Huh? I don't get it! I thought I'd figured it out.
Linda: (On the phone) Hello? Hello? Candace, are you there?
Candace: Sorry, Mom. Disregard everything I said.
Linda: Okay, sweetheart.
Grandma Winifred: Remember, no snacking. Dinner's at 1900.
Candace: Oh, okay. See you later. (To Stacy) What if 1600 isn't a place, but a time?
Stacy: I didn't get that impression.
Candace: Impression! Stacy, you're a genius. Wasn't it in one of those Holmes stories that they used pencil lead to reveal an impression on paper? Well, if my hunch is right... (She takes an impression of the missing half of the page) "To do today: Big Ben race to Thames at 1600 for water slide fun"! Stacy, 1600 is 4 o'clock which is right now! Let's go!
Agent Double 0-0: (firing his laser) Just a few more minutes.

Agent Double 0-0: Ow! Oh, there you go. Good thing I had the watch laser. Now Doofenshmirtz took the stairs, but if we work our way up the inner mechanism of the clock, he'll never see us coming.

Phineas: (Operating the water slide) Next!
(A grabber grabs a boy in a tire and takes him up the tower)
Candace: Phineas!
Phineas: Hey, guys! Do you like it?
Candace: I figured you guys were up to something. The tires, the pipes, I see what those were for, but what was with the pineapple?
Phineas: Oh, that was for Ferb. He was hungry.
Candace: (mocking) Oh, and the butter too, huh?
Phineas: No, no. He's using that for speed.
(Ferb, at the top of the slide, butters himself up. He rides down the slide, bounces off the River Thames and lands in a ferris wheel car at warp speed)
Referee: (Inside the car) It's a new world record!
Candace: Mom's gonna flip when she sees about this! (She starts dialing the phone, but the grabber takes her up the tower and she goes down the slide, screaming)
Linda: (answering the phone) Hello? (Candace tries to speak, but her speech is gibberish due to a bumpy area in the slide)
Someone with a thick cockney accent. (she turns off her phone) Wrong number.
(Candace continues to slide)
Stacy: Can I take a turn?
Phineas: Go for it. (Stacy goes up) Last customer of the day. (He goes up too)
(Candace slides off the slide and bounces into a car)
Stacy: Whoo-hoo! (slides off, lands in Candace's car)
Phineas: That's what I'm talking about! (slides off, lands in car)
Candace: Ooh! It's 4:15. Mom should be here. Mom! (bangs car glass) Look!Look up here!
Linda: (not hearing this) I hope the kids had fun today.
Doofenshmirtz: (On top of the tower) Well, It's about time!
(He presses a remote, the rocket engines fire, and Big Ben starts rumbling)
Candace: Mom, look! Mom, Mom!!!
Stacy: (seeing Big Ben about to launch, taps on Candace's shoulder) Uh...Candace?!
Candace: Not now, Stacy!
Stacy: But --
Candace: (she bangs on glass more) Mom! Mom!

Doofenshmirtz: (landing on the water slide Phineas and Ferb Built) Hey, look at this! It's like a ride! (part of the slide begin coming off) Woo-hoo! Cannonball! (The entire slide breaks into pieces and land in the water. Doofenshmirtz lands on the pavement) Well, I was expecting a bigger splash...

(Phineas and Ferb's car comes down, they come out)
Phineas: Hey, Mom, you missed all the fun.
Linda: Looks like we did. All right, let's catch a cab and head home. Come on!
Phineas: Looks like Candace and Stacy did some shopping.
Ferb: I'll never understand fashion.
(In the Flynn Fletcher front yard, a yard sale is being hosted)
Man: Oh cool! Old records! Lindana. Now that's a blast from the past. Wonder where she is now... Probably singing at retirement homes.
(Linda walks over)
Linda: Oh, give me that. (takes the box of records)
Man: Hey, you look familiar. 
(By the garage, Phineas and Ferb are examining some reals of film)
Phineas: Hey Dad, what are these?
Lawrence: Oh wow, those are my old black and white detective movies.
Phineas: Do you mind if we watch them?
Lawrence: Not at all boys, the projector's inside.
Phineas: Great, come on Ferb.
(A man grabs a doll from the box Lawrence was carrying)
Lawrence: Oh I see you like that little doll. Well lets see... that'll cost you, uh, fifty cents?
Doofenshmirtz: I'll give you a dollar.
(In the garage, Phineas and Ferb are watching some of the old detective movies)
Detective/Narrator: She rolled into my office like a fog bank. Mysterious. Cold. My instincts told me this dame was nothing but trouble. But trouble's my middle name... Well not really. My middle name is "Trumble"...Sounds a lot like trouble.
Phineas: Wow, this detective stuff is great.
Detective/Narrator: She had something she needed to say. And she spoke with the voice of an angel...
(Suddenly Candace bursts in, in front of the screen)
Candace: Phineas! Where's the box that was in my room?!
Phineas: Well dad was taking boxes out to the yard sale...
Candace: Dad, Dad, wait! (She arrives at the front yard) Dad, is that the box from my room?
Lawrence: Well yes...
Candace: I think I put my little Mary McGuffin doll in there by mistake. Have you seen her?
Lawrence: I just sold her for a whole dollar. Here, you can have it.
(Candace screams)
Lawrence: How about two dollars?

(Doofenshmirtz rings the doorbell)
Vanessa: Dad? What are you doing here? This isn't your weekend.
Doofenshmirtz: Yes, yes I know, but I have a surprise for you and I just couldn't wait!
Vanessa: (excited) A surprise? Really?
Doofenshmirtz: Yes, it's something you've always wanted. Something you've asked for time and time again. In my hand, I hold the key to...
Vanessa: ... My new car!
Doofenshmirtz: (holds up Mary McGuffin doll) No, your happiness! Remember when you said if I got you a little Mary McGufffin doll, I'd be the world's greatest dad?
Vanessa: Yeah, when I was like, seven.
Doofenshmirtz: At long last I have found one! I have been scouring the Internet and... and Garage sales trying to find the discontinued doll.
Vanessa: Wow, I can't believe you remembered I wanted this.
Doofenshmirtz: Remembered?! I never stop looking!
Vanessa: Really?
Doofenshmirtz: You know, I may be an evil scientist, but it doesn't take a degree purchased from the Internet with your ex-wife's money, to know how special and important you are to me.
Vanessa: That's so sweet.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, I'd better run. I bought a used -inator today at the garage sale, and it's missing one small part.
Vanessa: Really? what does it do?
Doofenshmirtz: I don't know yet, it's missing a part. But whatever it is I'm sure it will be pure evil!
Vanessa: (Talking to the doll) Well, at least you're not evil.
(Scene shifts to the Flynn-Fletcher home)
Phineas: (Talking like the detective from the film, with his and Ferb's bedroom painted black and white) It was a dull, hot day in Danville, and she swept into the room like a cool, tropical depression. I could tell by the way she walk, she had something on her mind, either that, or she was chaffing from the heat.
Candace: What's going on here?
Phineas: Her voice flowed soft and smooth, like butter on toast.
Candace: And why are you talking like that?
Phineas: She was observant, maybe too observant.
Candace: Why is everything black and white in here?
Phineas: (talking normally) We painted everything like an old detective movie.
Candace: What about you guys?
Phineas: Detective makeup.
Candace: Detectives? Perfect! I know what you're going to do today! Track down my little Mary McGuffin.
Phineas: Piece of cake. (Ferb hands him a piece of cake) Ooh, chocolate. Thanks Ferb. We'll have you're little Mary McGuffin back faster than you can say, "Hey, where's Perry?"
(Scene shifts to Perry's lair)
Carl: Sir, Agent P is here.
Major Monogram: I can see that Carl, now get back in that corner until I tell you, you can get up. Fifteen minutes left on the timer.
Carl: Okay Sir.
Major Monogram: Agent P. we, we just found out that Doofenshmirtz is scouring the Tri-State Area for some kind of on-off device.
Carl: A switch, Sir.
Major Monogram: Right, we think it may be a switch, but we don't know what it's for so, we need your help. Good luck Agent P.
Phineas: (Narrating while Ferb plays his sax) The sun beat down on the city like a hammer, a relentless hot beating hammer hammering down like a big metaphor that was... hot, for some reason.
Candace: Stop with the narration and start finding my doll!
Phineas: We decided to investigate at the scene of the crime. We talked to a Lawrence Fletcher, a tall gaunt looking average Joe who... (Ferb stops playing the sax, and Phineas switches back to his normal voice) Sorry.
Lawrence: Is that my old black and white saxophone?
Phineas: We thought the investigation could use a little ambiance.
Lawrence: Oh, delightful. How can I help?
Phineas: We need you to tell us everything you can about the man who bought the doll.
Lawrence: Well, let me see... He had some kind of a German accent, and ooh, he was wearing a lab coat.
Phineas: A lab coat, huh? Ferb? (Ferb begins to play the saxophone again) For an average Joe, he gave us an above average clue. Our next step was clear.
Lawrence: Who is he talking to?
Candace: Oh, don't get me started.

Charlene: Vanessa, Charitable Charities is here. Do you have your box ready?
Vanessa: Yeah Mom, it's next to my bookshelf.
(In Vanessa's room)
Charlene: Oops, looks like something fell out. (She picks up the Mary McGuffin doll, and puts it in the box)
Charlene: (At the Charitable Charities man) Here you go.
Man from Charitable Charities: Aww, thanks Char. I'll pick you up at eight.
Charlene: See you then Sam.
Phineas: (Narrating) We figured the best place to find a man in a lab coat was at the Lab Coat Emporium. We interviewed several suspects.
Suspect 1: Well, yes I was at a garage sale, but as you can see, I don't have an accent.
Suspect 2: Yeah, I have an accent, but I have not been to a garage sale.
Suspect 3: Whoa! Hey kid, slow down. I can't answer all these questions.
Candace: Well that wasn't very productive. Was it?
Phineas: We decided to have a talk with the owner.
(Shines a bright light onto the owner of the Lab Coat Emporium) What do you know about a man in a lab coat with a German accent, frequents garage sales?
Owner: Oh, that guy, I don't know anything about that guy.
Phineas: Alright Ferb, lean on him.
(Ferb leans on the owner of the store)
Owner: Alright, alright I'll talk. Okay, there's this guy. He comes in every week for a lab coat. He has me put everything on his ex-wife's tab. See, her address is on the bill.
Phineas: I do see. Well thanks a lot for your help. You can wrap it up Ferb.
(Ferb begins to fold up their interrogation room setup)
Owner: Can I take this makeup off now?
(Scene shifts to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated)
Doofenshmirtz: I can't believe how lucky I was at that garage sale, someones personal collection of on-off switches. Score! (Begins trying the switches on his -inator) Hmm, looks like this one doesn't fit, more where that came from. Nope. How 'bout this? Come on, Papa needs a band new -inator. (Gets hit in the head with a rubber duck) Oh! what the--? Perry the Platypus, are you making your own keys now? Oh, you like all the stuff I got at the garage sale? Want to know what else I got? This lobster trap!
(A lobster trap falls on Perry, trapping him.)
Doofenshmirtz: (Laughs evilly) Yeah, anyway, sorry I can't tell you my evil scheme, because I... I don't know what this does yet. I'm still looking for an on-off switch. Life was much simpler when I worked as a lawn gnome.
(Scene shifts to Charlene's house)
Vanessa: Mom!
Charlene: Yes, dear?
Vanessa: Have you seen my little Mary McGuffin Doll?
Charlene: Could it be the one I just put in the box for Charitable Charities?
Vanessa: Oh no, Dad gave that to me.
Charlene: Well, I'm sorry I didn't know. But I think the truck is still out there.
Vanessa: (She runs out the door, passing Phineas, Ferb and Candace as they come up.) Wait! Sam! I want to retain a portion of my mother's charitable donation!
Phineas: (Talking to Charlene) Hello ma'am. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Charlene: Are you with the census?
Phineas: No, ma'am, today we're detectives.
Charlene: Aren't you a little young to be detectives?
Phineas: If it's all the same to you ma'am, we'll ask the questions.
Charlene: Oh, okay come on in. Would you kids like some apple juice?
Phineas: That would be nice ma'am.
(In the same interrogation set up as before)
Phineas: Alright lady, what do you know about the little Mary McGuffin doll? (takes a sip of apple juice)
Charlene: You too? Well like I told my daughter, I gave it to charity.
Phineas: And?
Charlene: Well... nothing, that's it. The Charitable Charities truck just left, that have a few locations 'round town, so I'm not sure which one they're going to.
Phineas: Alright Ferb, pack it up. We've got some charities to visit. But I think we're going to need to update our approach.
Phineas: (Narrating during a montage asking Charitable Charities if that had the doll) We checked out act of the charitable charities in Danville, using every cop persona we could think of. In every case, it seemed we had the wrong location.
Charitable Charities Manager 3: Aren't you kids a little young to know about all these old detective shows?
Phineas: Yes, yes we... (Pauses and puts on sunglasses in a Horatio Caine like fashion) ...are.

Doofenshmirtz: Oh, man, how many different kinds of on-off switches can there be? I mean, look at this. An octagon? And one shaped like the Statue of Liberty? That doesn't even make sense. Oh, and here's one. The exact same size and shape that I'm looking for except it's upside-down. I mean, the words are actually printed upside-down. What kind of a dummkopf would invent an upside-down... switch...that... (Pauses, sighs, and flips the switch so that it's right-side-up.) I did it! Time to find out what this bad boy can do! (He flips the switch) On.
(Perry's lobster trap opens and he climbs out of it)
Doofenshmirtz: (Not realizing what is happening) Off. On. Off. On. Off. On. Augh, I'm herring a clanking voice, so I know it's doing something. (Realizes that the -inator opens the lobster trap) Oh, the -inator and the cage they're connected. It's just, opens and closes the... Well I guess that's why I got the cage for free.
(Perry grabs onto Doofenshmirtz, and throws him into a pile of junk)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey! I was talking! (Doofenshmirtz begins to sword battle with Perry, with a moose antler, and a marlin) Take that, and that! Hey lets see if you can take a couple hits, from the 70's! (Begins to throw record at Perry, who avoids them, and hides behind a painting) Ahh, that takes me back... Hey where'd you go? Yow! Is that, that shark's head? Are you trying to make me cry? Wait hold on one second here, just a second. It occurs to me that all this does is open and close a lobster cage; you know it's not even evil, much less illegal. Besides, I've run out of clever fighting puns so... Curse you Perry the Platypus.
(At a Charitable Charities)
Candace: There she is! My little Mary McGuffin Doll!
(Reaches for it buts someone else also does)
(Speaking to Vanessa, who was also grabbing for the doll) I'm sorry, but this is my doll.
Vanessa: No, it ended up here by mistake, and it's actually my doll.
Candace: You might think it's your doll, but it's not. I'm going to have to ask you to please let go!
Vanessa: You please let go.
Candace: You let go!
Ferb: (to Phineas) This is exactly why they took that doll off the market.
(Candace and Vanessa fall over, from fighting over the doll, and it goes flying, landing in Sally's arms)
Sally: Look. She's perfect, and I just love her.
Candace: Oh, forget it. I guess I'm too old for dolls anyway.
Vanessa: Yeah, maybe I don't really have to have the one object my dad spent years to find in order to show me his affection. (pause) No, actually I do. (at Sally) Give me that, kid!
(Vanessa takes the doll and leaves Sally crying)
Doofenshmirtz: (talking to Vanessa on the phone) So you just took it from the little girl and left her there crying? Wow, that is evil! Honey, I am so proud of you! It felt good didn't it? Yeah, we can build on this. (The last line of Not So Bad A Dad is reprised as episode ends.)

(Scene opens on early in the morning at the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Stanky Dog: (on radio) Good morning, Danville! Excitement's in the air today as we await the announcement of the Paisley Sideburn Brothers' first concert visit to the Tri-State Area! Phone lines are clogged and web sites are crashing as local music fans try to get first crack at the hottest concert tickets of the decade!
(Cut to Candace's room. Pan across to reveal her sleepily typing on the computer.)
Candace: Must...get...tickets...
(Cut to shot of the computer. Candace is typing www on the address bar, but her finger stays on the "w" key. Cut to reveal her face lying on the keyboard.)
Candace: Zzzzzzzzzzzz... (She takes her head out of the keyboard to reveal many keys in her face. They pop out to the music of "Shave and a haircut, two bits". She spits two keys out of her mouth.) Oh, still not on sale! (A crash is heard) What the?! 
(Cut to outside the house. Candace opens the window and sticks her head out.)
Candace: Hey, isn't it a bit early to start building another crazy contraption?!
(Cut to reveal Phineas and Ferb in the backyard with some pieces of their latest big idea in their hands.)
Phineas: What, this? We're still cleaning up from yesterday. It's funny, the cleanup usually takes care of itself, but we've been working all night on this one. (A recycling truck comes to take the dumpster.) That's the last of it, guys! Thanks! (to Candace) It was our biggest project ever! How could you miss it?
Candace: I was kind of busy. (Her phone rings. She zips inside and picks up.) Stacy, what's up?
Stacy: (on phone) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!! My ticket is in row R!!!! Close enough to smell them!!!!! What did you get?!!?
Candace: Ticket? How'd you get a ticket?
(Stanky Dog appears on the TV.)
Stanky Dog: That's right, folks! Unless you've had your head stickin' out of a window, you know those tickets just went on sale and sold out in 13 seconds flat!
Candace: Sold out!?!
Stanky Dog: That's right! Sold out! But you still might be able to catch this special added benefit concert tonight at the Fireside Girls Jamboree!

Candace: Okay, I still got a chance. (The computer beeps.) What the heck? (Computer displays:) "FIRESIDE GIRLS ONLY! PLEASE ENTER YOUR PATCH #"? (types frantically) Gotta guess the right numbers.

Phineas: Yes, Candace?
Candace: Your little friend, Isabella, she's a Fireside Girl, right?! What's her patch number?!
Phineas: I'm not sure. But I can ask her when she gets back from her meeting at the Fireside Girl lodge.
Candace: Lodge, huh? C'mon, you're takin' me down there. Now!
(She grabs Phineas and exits at breakneck speed. Ferb looks down to realize something.)
Ferb: Hey, where's Perry?

Major Monogram: Morning, Agent P. We're not sure what Doofenshmirtz is up to, but we're sending you to his lab. (Puts on a pair of safety goggles) And we're using this new transporter device we've been working on. It's not approved for testing on humans yet, so you get to try it out first.

Candace: Tell you what, I'm joining up! (slams her hand on the podium) Set me up, sister!
Isabella: Okay. I hereby nominate Candace Flynn into membership in the Loyal Sisterhood of Fireside Girls.
Katie and Ginger: I second! Jinx! (they giggle)
(In the background, Perry gets zapped into the lodge and then zapped out.)
Isabella: Alright, girls, come to order. (to Candace) Now, just fill out this application, read the training manual, sign the insurance waivers, and you can be sworn in at our meeting next week.
Candace: Next week?! But that's too late!
Isabella: I'm sorry, but the traditional procedure comes straight from the Fireside Rules of Order (shows her what looks like a portrait of an old lady in a rocking chair) as established by our founder, Eliza M. Feyersied.
Candace: Well, that's a stupid rule.
Eliza M. Feyersied: (from the "portrait") You watch your mouth, little lady!
Candace: Who puts a picture frame on a window?
Phineas: Is there anything Ferb and I can do to help? Candace really wants to see that concert.
Isabella: Candace, if-if you don't really want to be a Fireside Girl, then—
Candace: No no, I do, I do! I've gotta get to that concert!
Isabella: Candace, you're not listening to me. You don't—
Candace: Pfft! Forget it! I thought Fireside Girls were supposed to help people.
Eliza M. Feyersied: (bursts through the door) There is another way!
(The girls gasp)
Isabella: You don't mean—
Eliza M. Feyersied: Yes! Isabella, please read Article 9, Section Charlie, Footnote 6.
Isabella: "A troop leader may award full Fireside Girl status to any girl who has earned 50 patches." But, Mrs. Feyersied, 50 patches in one day?! Is that even possible?!
Eliza M. Feyersied: Well, it depends on how badly she wants it.
Candace: Bring it on!
Isabella: Alright! All you need is a cadet uniform and we can get started.
Candace: Okay. Where can I buy one?
(The Fireside Girls giggle. Cut to Candace at a sewing machine making a uniform.)
Candace: Ouch! (she puts her finger in her mouth)

(Double wipe to show Candace, Phineas and Ferb outside. Phineas and Ferb are showing their sister a diagram.)
Phineas: Then after you wrestle the crocodiles, you'll corkscrew through the overpass and free fall past the flaming high wire to make your last delivery and receive the 50th patch. Got it?
Candace: Is all that really necessary?
Phineas: We're going to need you to plant one of these Fireside Girl markers at the site of each task so the girls at the lodge can track your progress. Now, is Candace Gertrude Flynn your full legal name?
Candace: Ugh. Yes.
Isabella: Great! You just earned your Honesty Patch! Congratulations!

Phineas: 48 to go!
Candace: Yippee! This is easy!
Phineas: Okay. (quiz show music plays in the background) 15 senior citizens need help crossing a street that's 50 feet across.
Candace: Ooh, goody, I'm great at word problems.
Phineas: No, there's 15 senior citizens that need help crossing the street. (Cut to reveal Candace on roller skates on a conveyor belt.) Good luck, Candace. Don't forget your helmet. (He pulls the lever and gives her a helmet as she rolls down screaming.)

Milly: Fireside Girls. Would you like to buy some of our cupcakes?

(End flashback) 
Doofenshmirtz: So with my weakness for high-carb sweets, there's really no other choice but to get rid of the bridge to the Fireside cupcake factory. And my Metal-Destructinator can turn any metal object into broccoli. I know what you're thinking, why broccoli? But, w-well, y'know, it's healthy. It's like the opposite of what I'm trying to get— It's—It's poetic justice. It's—Well, it's not—not justice, exactly... Poetic evil. It's poetically evil. Now, to make some last-minute adjustments...

Candace: No, I can do this.
(She runs off while an acoustic guitar version of "Go Candace" plays in the background.)
Phineas: Now that's persistence.
Candace: I see the building and I still got three minutes! (She reads the directory.) Got it, 38th floor! (She runs to the elevator, but it is out of order) Out of order?! Okay, stairs. Step aerobics, don't fail me now!
(She runs up the stairs while the music becomes slower. Whip pan up to Doof and Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: Come back here! (Perry grabs a piece of the inator and bends it.) Oh, what are you doing down there?! (Perry activates it and salutes and gets teleported away. The inator turns into broccoli.) Uh-oh. Aaaaah!! (Groans and spits some broccoli out) Curse you, Perry the— (knock at the door) Coming.
(Doof opens the door to reveal an exhausted Candace.)
Candace: Fireside Girl. Here's your order of cupcakes.
Doofenshmirtz: Aren't you a little old to be a Fireside Girl?
Candace: Yes. Yes, I am. 
(Cut to the lodge.)
Isabella: (offscreen) Candace, we are all very impressed. (cut to inside) You earned more patches in one day than anyone in the history of the Fireside Girls: 49 patches, which pretty much blows away the previous record of 6 patches held by our own Adyson Sweetwater.
Adyson: Aw, nuts!
Candace: No, I know I did all 50 and I made sure to plant the markers and everything. (holds up a marker) Huh? Looks like I forgot one. I'll just run back before it's five o'clock.
(bell rings)
Isabella: I'm sorry, Candace. Y'know, you may not have lit up the entire board, but you did demonstrate remarkable persistence.
Candace: You mean I get a persistence patch? And that makes 50, right? (short beat) There's no Persistence Patch, is there?
Isabella: Nope. 'Fraid not.
Eliza M. Feyersied: Hold on, Isabella. Little Miss Sassy Mouth here gets a special patch for breakin' the all-time record. (salutes) Congratulations, Fireside Girl! And here's your ticket for the Paisley Sideburn Brothers concert.
Candace: Let's go! 
(Cut to the concert. Phineas and Ferb are whistling and cheering with Candace and the Fireside Girls.)
Phineas: Woo! Yeah!
Candace: Phineas and Ferb? How did you guys get in?
Phineas: Isabella invited us. She's allowed to bring guests, you know.
Isabella: That's what I kept trying to tell you, Candace, but you were so insistent on becoming a Fireside Girl. Maybe you can start working on your Good Listener Patch next.
(Candace simply stares in disbelief.) 
(Scene opens showing Buford playing a Mario-like video game, playing similar music, with his face on the video game character, while Phineas, Ferb, and Baljeet watch him.)
Buford: See? Isn't this the coolest game ever? It's called Jump and Duck.
Phineas: Hey, how'd you get your face in there?
Buford: Easy. I just use this camera. See? (takes picture of Phineas)
Phineas: (with spinning eyes) Cool.
Buford: (demonstrating how to add in the picture, tilting the game controller and wildly pushing buttons) And then you do this, and this, and this and this and this and this and this, and this, and this, and this, and this and this, and then this and this, and then that.
(He hands the controller to Phineas.)
Buford: Look.
(Before our eyes, the little Buford character's head shrinks and is replaced by Phineas' silly face from the picture.)
Phineas: This is awesome. 
(Scene switches to outside Candace's window, then to her room.)
Candace: (on her cell phone) Stacy, you are talking to the luckiest girl in the house! Jeremy is taking me to the summer cotillion! Cotillion. It's like a dance. Yes, it's a real word. All I know is it's gonna be great. Wait a minute, I just thought of something, two somethings actually. And one of them is pointy. Stacy, I'll call you back. It's time for a little preemptive bust. 
(In the backyard)
Phineas: So, beyond jumping and ducking, what's the actual objective of this game?
Buford: It's called Jump and Duck. Duh.
Baljeet: I can see no educational value in this game.
Buford: (at Baljeet) Duck!
(Baljeet does so, while narrowly escaping Buford's punch, that was coming towards his head)
Buford: (Laughing) Consider yourself educated.
Baljeet: I stand corrected.
Phineas: Far be it for me to cast dispersions on jumping, and or ducking, but I think you can improve this. With a little effort we could-
Candace: (Now in the backyard) Okay. What are you guys up to?
Phineas: Playing a video game.
Candace: That's it? That's all you're doing today? Huh. How normal. I guess my night's safe after all. Who would have guessed you two would get sucked into a video game? I'm going to go get ready.
Phineas: (Angelic chorus in the background) "Sucked into a video game". Brilliant! Ferb! I know what we're going to do today. Hey, where's Perry? 
(In Perry's lair)
Major Monogram: Good morning Agent P. I've been monitoring Doofenshmirtz's internet activity. First, we know what you're getting for Christmas. Don't ask our lips are sealed... it's a vase. Second, he's been doing a lot of research into the molecular of taffeta, satin, and most ominous of all, velour. Ugh! (Monogram shudders, and the feed cuts out)

Candace: (in her room) Hey!
Phineas: And once your zapped into the video game by the digitizer-
Candace: Okay, what's going on? I was drying my hair.
Phineas: Sorry about the power, Candace. Ferb went to check the circuit breaker.

Phineas: We didn't go anywhere, but you're inside the video game.

Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus, you are too late. Wait, is it eleven o'clock yet? (Pauses for a beat) Now! Now you are too late. So Perry the Platypus, tremble in fear before the most twisted, nightmarish creation the world has ever known! The Ball gown-inator. (Doofenshmirtz grabs the Ball gown-inator, and fires it at Perry, leaving him in a ball gown. Perry tries to jump at Doofenshmirtz, but falls due to his ball gown. A pair of mechanical arms pick of Perry so that he is at Doofenshmirtz's level) See, Perry the Platypus? It's hard to fight when you're in a ball gown. It's portable too. Ooh, you look so elegant, like you're going to a cotillion. It's a word, it means dance. So, why would I created such a device as this? Hm? Hm?
(Flashback)
Doofenshmirtz: (Narrating) You see, back in Gimmelshtump in the depths of my childhood, my parents were expecting a brand new baby girl. My mother spent months knitting pretty dresses. Unfortunately, the baby turned out to be a boy, and because we were out of material, I was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year. Drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates.
(Flashback ends)
Doofenshmirtz: Now with my ball gown-inator, I will be the manliest man in the Tri-State Area! You know, by comparison. Because everyone else will be wearing dress. After I shoot them with my ball gown-inator. Am, am I over explaining this? Because I have this whole musical number prepared, and... Oh, oh you're good. Okay. (at the dancers) Take five girls. 
(Candace is in the video game running away from the fruit)
Candace: You guys better get me out of here! I still have to get ready!
Phineas: Well, we designed a whole bunch of different worlds you have to go through to get to the boss, but you know just, just continue screen right.
Candace: Can't you just press a button and get me there now?
Phineas: Oh, you want cheat codes. No, we don't roll like that. Just jump and Duck. (Candace gets hit by fruits) Okay not necessarily in that order. Just choose the appropriate action that corresponds to the approaching fruit.
Candace What does that even mean?
Phineas: Duck! (Candace got hit by the door) Now run! (Candace gets hit by a ramp) Duck! (Candace's head got sucked) Okay, you can try to jump here (Candace fall on a platform) Duck! Duck! Duck! (Candace falls on the stairs) Okay stop falling Candace keeps falling) stop falling (Candace keeps falling) (talking to Ferb) Sheesh. Maybe we should go help her. Don't worry Candace, we're coming!
(The fruit jumps at Candace, but she shoots them with her hair dryer, causing them to melt, and restoring her health)
Candace: Hmm, maybe they should call it Jump, Duck, and Blow (Candace then begins to run through the world, shooting everything in her path)
(Phineas and Ferb appear in the video game)
Phineas: Whoa, what happened here? Oh that's right, Candace has her hair dryer. We'll just follow the carnage.

Phineas: Wow, the castle. Nice art direction, Ferb. I guess Candace already made it to the boss level. (The boss, designed after Buford appears behind them) Sweet! Come on.
(They run away, narrowly avoiding being crushed by the boss)
Phineas: I forgot that we made Buford the boss. It's a little disturbing having him trying to obliterate us, but it made him so happy.
(Buford the boss catches up with them, and grabs them)
Candace: Hey ugly! Drop the twerps you freak. (The Boss does so, and walks toward Candace) Nobody picks on my brothers but- (The bosses knocks Candace over, causing her to lose the hair dryer, and diminishing her health)

Phineas: Well yeah, we have, like four lives left.

Phineas: Awesome, we're out. So you must have beat the boss.
Candace: Yeah, it was a piece of cake.
Phineas: Cool, how'd you get him the second time?
Candace: What do you mean, "second time"?
Phineas: You know how after you defeat him the first time, he comes back, and this time he's twice as strong? What'd you do then?
Candace: Um...
(Behind them the Buford-Boss appears)
Phineas: The last level's in the real world. Run!
Buford: No guys, he looks like a nice guy. Ow.

Buford: Okay, maybe not.
Baljeet: (Mockingly) Oh, now I see the educational value.

Baljeet: (Scoffs) Oh, what a nerd.
Phineas: Is that a lock of Ferb's hair?
Irving: (Snatches book back) Don't touch it.
Phineas: Irving suggested hide and seek.
Buford: Isn't the house a little too small to play a good game of hide and seek?
Ferb: Perhaps the problem is not that the house is too small, but that we are too big.

Phineas: What is that thing? Did we ever make mechanical bugs?
Irving: There's nothing in the book.

Candace: See, Mom?! See, see?! (Sees nothing on the counter) WHAT?!! But it was right here!!! I swear there was this machine...and we were tiny...but then we got bigger... (rest is under) and, and...
Linda: (with disdain, overlapping) Oh, teenagers.
Vivian: Ay, los jóvenes. 
Doofenshmirtz: Well, that's done. And no comeuppance.
(Pause. A sad violin plays in the background)
Why do I feel so empty? 
(Scene opens up on Phineas and Ferb in their backyard.)
Phineas: Ah, here's the doo-hickey that fuses with your spinal cord.
Isabella: Hey guys. What'cha doooin'?
Phineas: Today, we're gonna fuse our nervous systems with Dad's laptop and surf the web using only our cerebral cortexes.
Baljeet: Wow! Surely that would be quite an exciting project.
Phineas: Oh, hey Baljeet. Why are you dressed like a vegetable samosa?
Baljeet: Because today is the Tri-State Area Unification Day! I learned all about it in Assimilation class. You see, the Tri-State Area was the bi-state area until our founder, the great John P. Trystate, uttered the immortal words:
John P. Trystate: The, uh, bi-state area should be united with that adjacent area right over there.
Phineas: But we knew that. I was just wondering why you're dressed like a vegetable samosa.
Baljeet: Oh, that. My Uncle Kamal is doing an exotic cuisine float in the parade, and I'm the...
Phineas and Baljeet: Vegetable samosa!
Buford: Hey!
Baljeet: Buford?
(Buford walks up, and is also dressed up as a vegetable samosa.)
Buford: I thought I was supposed to be the vegetable samosa!
Baljeet: Why can we not both be vegetable samosas?
Buford: Oh, sure, two vegetable samosas! Why don't we all just dress like vegetable samosas? In fact, why don't we just all dress like mashed potatoes and take the word exotic right off the sign?!
Baljeet: Buford, wait!
Buford: No, man. It's over! I'm gonna go find another nerd!
Baljeet: But what about the Tri-State Area Unification Day parade?
Buford: What? Is that what this parade is for?
Baljeet: Does no one know what today is?
Buford: Well, excuse me, but that adjacent area was founded by my great-uncle Otto H. Adjacent! He didn't wanna be no part of no Tri-State Area unification, and neither do I! The blood of Otto H. Adjacent runs through these veins, and blood is thicker than water! (leaves)
Baljeet: Well, mango chutney is thicker than blood.
Buford: (Yelling) You're dead to me!
Phineas: (to Ferb) Parade? I love parades. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today instead! We're gonna... Hey, where's Perry? 
(In Perry's lair)
Major Monogram: Ah, there you are, Agent P. Well, let's get down to brass tacks... (reading his clipboard) What's this? "Happy passive-agressive relationship day"? Oh, is that today?
Carl: That's okay, you probably weren't gonna get me anything, anyway.
Monogram: Weel, I completely forgot.
Carl: No, no, you know I didn't even want a present.
Monogram: Anyway... Where were we? For some reason, Doofenshmirtz has purchased a tow truck. Which isn't evil in itself, but he may be planning on towing something evil, so, check it out.

Linda: Candace? Are you ready for our girl's day out?
Candace: Just a sec mom! (She goes outside) Aha! Wait a minute. Are you guys just out here arranging kiddie wagons?
Phineas: At the moment.
Candace: Hmm, carry on. (Candace gets into the car with Linda) All clear, luckily the boys aren't up to anything.
(In the backyard, a large animatronic John P. Trystate is lowered onto their kiddie wagons)
Phineas: A little to the left. There you go.
Linda: Candace, you have to promise me that you won't obsess about Phineas and Ferb.
Candace: Yeah, sure Mom, I promise.
Linda: Don't just promise this time. Raise your right hand. Do you Candace Gertrude Flynn, solemnly swear not to obsess about your brothers, or you'll suffer the pharaoh's curse?
Candace: The pharaoh's curse?
Linda: Yes or No?
Candace: Okay, yes.
Linda: Okay, now we can have fun.

(Perry bursts through the floor)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus? (Doofenshmmirtz activates a trap, trapping perry in a door) Hahaha! You like that? I call it my "Indoors-inator". I got the idea from the Perry-shaped hole you left in my wall, and in my bathroom door, a-and in my fridge. Man you were hungry that day. Anyway, here's my evil plan. (He reveals his new -inatr) Ta-da! I'm calling it the "Duplic-8-inator". Get it? Duplic-, then the number "8", then -inator. I'll bet you're wondering what it does, huh? Here I'll show you.
(He fires off the -inator)
Farmer's Wife: I can't believe you started a monkey basketball team, and you've only got one monkey.
(The ray from the -inator hits the monkey, duplicating that monkey eight times)
Farmer's Wife: Oh great, now three of them are going to have to sit on the bench.
Doofenshmirtz: See? It duplicates everything eight times. When I zap those streets there will be eight times the traffic, and Danville will come to a standstill! That's where I will make off like a bandit. You see I bought this tow-truck off the internet, I'm going to call it the "Tow-inator" or something. And open a service, and then I'll go and... 'Course it'll be hard for me to drive anywhere, with all that traffic. T-that's a bridge I'll cross when I get there. 
Nerd: (From atop a building) I've never been bullied into stopping a parade before. What should I do?
Buford: (Sighing) I don't know if this is working out. Can you talk in an Indian accent?
Nerd: Indian accent? No. I can do an English accent, instead! (Speaking with an English accent) Hello, gov'! Top of the mornin', toodle pip! Last night Mr. Governor, my toilet was broken in two.
Buford: (He sighs) Actually that was pretty good. 
Phineas: Okay everyone, let's show everybody what Tri-State unification is all about. Cue Love Händel!

Nerd: Mamma mia. That was a-close.

Linda: See Candace? Isn't this nice just to get away and enjoy a day together?
Candace: You're right Mom, this is the best. I'm not even going to think about– Mm, you know. I'm not even going to say their names.
Linda: That's the spirit.
Candace: I'm just going to sit here and enjoy, Ooh, the parade coming by. Haha, look at that kid in the cute little car. (She notices that the kid is Phineas) Gah! (Candace slaps both hands over her mouth) Mom! Ah! What am I doing? I am blocking my view. What my brothers do doesn't affect me. Letting it go for just one day. (She takes a breath) Nails. Happy relaxing fun.
Linda: You say something, honey? 
(Buford and his nerd dressed as policemen redirect the parade toward the junkyard)
Buford: Now they're headin' for the junkyard. From whose gravitational pull, it'll be impossible to escape. Am I thinkin' of a junkyard, or something else?
Phineas: Ferb! Treacherous terrain coming up. Execute operation: Thing in our way.
(Phineas's car scoops up the front half of the parade, the floats shrink down, and begin walking on four legs)
Buford: (Watching) AHHHH! Otto H. Adjacent will be avenged! 
Doofenshmirtz: Now, which button was it? Because one of these buttons just makes it fire willy-nilly all over the place. And, I don't want to hit that one by mistake. (Perry uses his tail to knock on the door that is holding him) Oop, someone's at the door. I'll be right there. Oh excuse me Perry the Platypus, what can I do- (He opens the door, freeing Perry, who punches Doofenshmirtz into the Dupic-8-inator, setting it off) Oh see there, that's, that's the willy-nilly button. (Perry dives at Doofenshmirtz, while the -inator fires off randomly) 
Candace: Mom, this place is so fancy-schmancy.
Linda: I just hope it isn't too noisy with that silly parade going on outside.
Candace: Believe me, I'm trying to tune it out.
Linda: So, what looks good to you?
Candace: (Blocking her view of the parade with her menu) Remember the pharaoh's curse. Wait! It doesn't count if she sees them herself! Hey mom, I bet you can't turn your head 180 degrees like an owl.
Linda: (Turning her head) Nope, just ninety.
Candace: Hey, can you show me that twisty yoga move you do again?
Linda: Maybe after lunch, dear.
Candace: I'm curious what the back of your chair looks like, can you turn around and show me?
Linda: Okay, Candace, what's up?
Candace: Mom! Why can't you just turn around!!??
Linda: (turning, just as Phineas and Ferb's floats leave) Okay you want me to turn around? I'm turning around. Can we just eat lunch now?!
Candace: (pauses) Fine... 
Buford: (From atop a building, overlook the parade) If that parade makes it to the end, my hopes for the Adjacent Area secession are through. I gotta stop it.
Nerd: (Speaking with a German accent) What is your next plan? I know it is going to be something clever!
Buford: That's it! The other accents were amusing, but that one's just offensive. (He hops onto one of the passing floats)
Nerd: (Still speaking with the accent) Wait! What about me?
Buford: I'm firin' you as my nerd.
Nerd: Das ist nicht gut. (This is not good.)
(A stray beam from Doofenshmirtz's Dupic-8-inator hits the small balloons on the kids' floats, duplicating them eight times; causing the floats to lift up off the ground and fly away.)
Isabella: Well, that's weird that our floats are floating away.
Phineas: Yeah, well, they are called "floats".
Buford: (From atop one of the floating floats) What the–? (He unties a singular balloon, that pulls him away) 
(Perry and Doofenshmirtz continue to fight, and Perry manages to get Doofenshmirtz to fall off his building onto a nearby floating balloon)
Doofenshmirtz: A platypus balloon? (The balloon passes by a billboard with a man wearing a fedora, and the balloon picks the hat up.) A Perry the Platypus balloon?! 
(At a shoe shop)
Linda: Candace I'm having a great time with you today. See how relaxing to os when you're not abscessing about your brothers?
(Pause, Candace strains and groans.)
Candace: I can't take it anymore!! Mom, I really tried to my best to give you a day, but it's...the boys. The boys! They're in the parade! With giant floats! So come on, you've gotta bust them. (Grabs her and runs off) 
Buford: (Still floating on the balloon, and seeing the Tri-State area) Wow, it's all just one, big place. No Bi-State area. No Adjacent Area, It's all just one big Tri-State Area, right over there! (The string he was holding onto rips off the balloon, opening a hole on the balloon) Uh-oh. Mamma!
Doofenshmirtz: You know this balloon is actually– (He is cut off, as the balloon flutters about wildly) AHH! Curse you Perry the Platypus Balloon!!
Baljeet: (Seeing Buford fall) Oh no! Buford is in trouble! I must do something! (He goes to a man selling balloons) Please, my bully is in trouble, let go of all of your balloons.
Balloon Man: Yeah, okay. (He releases all of his balloons)
Baljeet: Thank you.
Balloon Man: No, thank you, vegetable samosa.
(Buford grabs onto some of the balloons and slows his fall.)
Fighter jet Pilot: Uh, did you guys see that? Let's investigate.
Phineas: What we really need is a grand finale, so spectacular, that people will always remember Tri-State Area Unification Day.
Isabella: Hey what's that?
Buford: (Coming down from his balloon, then releasing them) Happy...Tri-State...Unification...Day! Woo-Yeah!

Fighter jet Pilot: Yeah, just some Unification Day Parade stunt.
Phineas: That'll do it. Hey, Buford great finale.
Isabella: Yeah, it was really, really nice.
Buford: Nice? Ah, now I gotta go do some'in' to balance out the universe. See ya' on the news. (He walks off)
Baljeet: Wait, wait, no Buford. No. No. No. Please don't. (A red liquid splashes Phineas, Ferb and Isabella) I was going to eat those jelly doughnuts.

Candace: Keep up with me, Dad! We're getting out of rhythm!
Lawrence: I'm trying!
(They slow down and the other racers pass them by.)
Candace: Ow! Oh, Dad, it's hopeless.
Lawrence: Bubble gum, bubble gum, running in a sack. (Candace smiles) Hop to the finish and don't look back!
Candace: Dad, you remember!
Candace and Lawrence: ♪ Bubble gum, bubble gum, running in a sack, ♪
(They start hopping again.)
♪ Hop to the finish and don't look back! ♪ 
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb.)
Phineas: Isabella, park the blimp and get everyone down here for the final cheer!
(Cut to Isabella in the blimp.)
Isabella: We're on our way! (She parks the blimp and the Fireside Girls slide down the ladders.) 
Candace and Lawrence: ♪ Bubble gum, bubble gum, running in a sack, ♪
♪ Hop to the finish and don't look back! ♪ 
(Cut to Doof's plane falling apart. He falls out of it screaming.)
Doofenshmirtz: (praying) Please I wanna live I wanna live I wanna live! (lands on something. Zoom out to reveal it's the blimp.) What? I'm alive! Woohoo! (Part of the plane lands on him.) Ow! (More parts of the plane fall on him. Followed by a nail, which deflates the blimp) Curse you, Perry the Platypus, even though you weren't involved in this scheme, whatsoever!!!!
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb who are wearing giant Lawrence and Candace heads made of paper maché cheering with the Fireside Girls.)

(Lawrence and Candace cross the finish line.)
Linda: Great job! I'm so proud of you guys!
Candace: Mom, it was awesome!
Linda: Look, honey!
Judge: (offscreen) And the winner is...Candace Flynn and her dad, Lawrence!
Linda and Candace: Yippee!!! Yay!!!!
Lawrence: Huzzah!!!
Judge: (giving them the trophy) Congratulations!
Candace: Thank you! Heh. And thank you, Dad.
Lawrence: Do you know, Candace, I don't remember much of what happened here today, (hugs his daughter) but I'll never forget this moment with you.
(Cut to Phineas as Perry approaches him.)
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry!
Balthazar: Hey, haven't I seen you before? 
(Zoom out, cutting to the Agency headquarters as Monogram sees what just happened on a monitor.)
Major Monogram: Carl, we gotta fire up the memory eraser again. 
(Scene opens up showing Phineas, Ferb, and Perry in the backyard.)
Phineas: What to do, what to do, what to do today. Any ideas, Ferb?
(Ferb shrugs)
Phineas: What about you, Perry? Bursting with any plans?
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: Ah. I'll never get tired of you doing that.
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: Awesome. (Chatters) Come on, Ferb. Fire one off.
Ferb: (Chatters)
(All chattering)
Phineas: I wonder what that means.
(Perry chatters)
Phineas: Hey, Ferb! I know what we're gonna do today! Let's build a Perry translator. We can finally figure out what (Chatters) means. Some say he's just a mindless platypus, but he might actually be thinking some profound thoughts. Just like another quiet animal I know.
(All chattering) 
(Scene shifts to Candace's room)
Candace: Stacy, it's been four days. (Rolls her chair to a picture referencing Cinderella. The faces are replaced with Candace and Jeremy's faces) I'm not expecting Prince Charming to bring me a glass slipper or anything, but a phone call would be nice. (Phone beeping) Hold on, I've got another call. (Gasps) (Holds up the phone, showing a heart with Jeremy's face in it) It's him! Call you back! Bye! (Phone beeps) Hello?
Jeremy: Hey, Candace. It's Jeremy.
Candace: Well, good morrow to you, sir.
Jeremy: Huh?
Candace: (Chuckles) I mean, what's up?
Jeremy: I just got the new Destruction Mayhem 3 game. I thought maybe you'd like to come over and try it out.
Candace: (Sarcastically) Oh, yeah, you, me, and little Suzy playing a video game, huh?
Jeremy: Suzy? No. She's at her friend's house. (The door knocks and he pauses the game) Uh, hold on, Candace. Someone's at the door. (Opens the door)
Candace: (Panting) So, video games? 
(Song: Quirky Worky Song (Instrumental))
(Back at the backyard, Phineas sets up the animal translator's mic and pounds it)
Phineas: All set over here!
(Ferb plugs in a tube and flips a switch. He thumbs up signalling it's set)
Phineas: Okay. Now all we need is our subject. Where's Perry? 
(Perry slides down a tube and lands on his chair. Inside the lair, the lights go up and down as electricity fizzes in the background)
Major Monogram: Ah, there you are, Agent P. Sorry about the lights. We're using an alternative energy source, and haven't got it working smoothly yet. I decided it was high time our operation went green. All right, assignment, assignment. Oh, let's see... We're saving paper by printing on the same one over and over again, so... Uh, sorry for the life on me. (Turns the paper, showing black ink all over it) I can't make this out. Hmm... Well, I'm sure it says something about Doofenshmirtz. Go get him!
(Perry salutes and leaves)
Major Monogram: (Gets up and walks off-screen) For crying out loud, Carl, (Carl is seen pedaling the generator, panting) pedal faster. I gotta check my E-mail. 
(Perry comes out of a fence board)
Phineas: Perry! (Perry switches to pet mode. Phineas walks on-screen) Oh, there you are. Come on, boy. Here, just take a seat. (Puts him on a stool) Stay. All set.
(Ferb turns on the translator)
Phineas: (Holding up a mic) Okay, Perry. It's time to hear what's on your mind. Hit me with your (Chatters) shot.
(Perry is about to chatter when Isabella interrupts)
Isabella: Hey, Phineas! What'cha dooooin'?
Phineas: Oh. Ferb and I invented a Perry translator so we can finally figure out what he's saying.
Isabella: That's great. (Her face becomes sheepish) But don't you need Perry to be here for it to work?
Phineas: (Turns his head, noticing Perry is gone) That was weird. Perry was here a second ago.
Translator: I sure love worms. (Phineas and Ferb hear this and turn to Isabella, thinking she said that)
Isabella: Don't look at me.
Translator: Big, fat, juicy worms!
(Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella hear the voice and turn to the microphone on the translator. A red bird is shown on the mic. The bird then chirps into the microphone.)
Translator: Gotta find 'em, gotta eat 'em!
(The bird flies off)
Phineas and Isabella: Whoa.
(The bird lands on a tree branch)
Phineas: Hello, birdie. Do you understand me?
(Bird chirps)
Translator: Aren't you a little young for inter-speciel communication?
Phineas: Yes. Yes I am. How about you, squirrel? Do you understand me? (Points the mic at the squirrel)
(Squirrel squeaks)
Translator: Oh, I do. Do you have any nuts for me?
Isabella: That's so cute.
Squirrel: (Squeaks)
Translator: Yeah yeah yeah, I'm cute. I'm cute. Now, nut me.
Phineas: Wow. This works on all animals.
Isabella: Hey, do you think it would work on my dog, Pinky? He barks at the door when a doorbell rings on TV. I'd love to explain the whole concept to him.
Phineas: Couldn't hurt to try.
Isabella: (Runs off) Great! I'll be right back.
Phineas: Wow! With a device like this, all animals can finally say what's on their minds.
(The bird chirps and flies off, and chirps as it flies. The pigeons hear it, and they fly off. A dog hears it, barks, and enters a dog door, barking at the cats. The cats meow and run out the dog door, and more animals run down the street to the driveway at the Flynn-Fletcher house) 
(Scene shifts to the Johnson house)
Jeremy: I'm really glad you wanted to come over, Candace. Most girls really aren't into stuff like this.
Candace: Pssh. Most girls. I guess I'm just cool like that. Yup, love me my video games. (A poodle pops up) Who's this?
Jeremy: Yeah, that's Suzy's dog. (Rubs her head) Who's a good girl? Who's a good girl? Yeah.
Candace: Yeah. Who's the good girl? Who's the good girl?
(The poodle growls at Candace)
Candace: Obviously, not me. 
♪ Doofenshmirtz out in the forest! ♪ 
(Perry snaps a stick on the ground. Doofenshmirtz turns around)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus? Don't be shy, It's just me. Come here. (A cage falls) (Laughs) You like my new cage? I got it from a second-hand shark supply store. It was half off, because you know, something bit half of it off. So, here's my evil plan: With this remote, I will open the Danville Dam, flooding all the streets and creating beautiful waterways! Like the canals in Venice, Italy! (Italian music plays) Or to a lesser extent, Venice, California. (Surf rock music plays) But how will people get around? They will have to buy my latest invention! It's like a car, but it can drive on the surface of water. (Pulls the tarp) Behold! You like it? I call it the Buoyancy Operated Aquatic Transport, or BO-AT for short. Everyone will want one. 
(Scene shifts to the Flynn-Fletcher house, where there's a long line of animals waiting to use the animal translator)
(Cat meows)
Phineas: Yeah, I see what you're saying, but you don't have an argument. They're giving you 12 cans a day. Technically, you're not underfed. All right, next!
(Scottish Terrier barks)
Phineas: Oh yeah. I've been getting a lot of complaints about the vacuum. Just let it out. 
(Scene shifts back to the Johnson house)
Candace: Hey, look at this. I'm getting the hang of it. (Game beeping)
Jeremy: No, actually Candace, you just paused it. (Game sounds) And now you've reset the game.
(Suzy's poodle lifts her leg, Liquid splashing)
Candace: (Gasps) Oh no. These we're brand new.
Jeremy: Hey, bad dog! That's weird. Suzy trained her so well.
Candace: (Suspiciously) I see. Suzy trained her.
I can't believe this. Hey, that's my shoe!
Jeremy: Uh, okay in there, Candace?
Candace: Yeah, yeah. (at poodle) (Gasps) Don't even think about it! (Gasps, throws paper towels into toilet)
Poodle: (Drops shoe)
(Candace flushes the toilet)
Candace: Where's my shoe? No, no, no! (Grunting)
(Splash)
Jeremy: Hey, Candace. Ready for the third level? (Door slams) Candace? 
(Scene shifts to the backyard at the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Isabella: Phineas?
Phineas: What's up?
Isabella: Okay. We've got 78 complaints about food quantity, 42 requests for belly rubs, and we're still trying to explain TV to Pinky.
Milly: Again, forget the idea of little people in there.
Isabella: So, what exactly are we supposed to do with this information?
Phineas: Hmm...
Ginger: Okay. The Jones's hamster is gonna lose it if someone doesn't oil the wheel in its cage.
Hamster: Hmph!
Ginger: Well, what now?
Phineas: That's what we'll do. Let's tell all the owners what their pets want! Starting with this little fella right here. (hamster squeaks) Sorry. Lady. Lady right here. (at Candace) Hey, Candace!
Candace: What is going on here?
Phineas: We made an animal translator! We'll tell you all about it later. Right now we're on a mission. Come on, guys.
Isabella: See ya, Candace!
Candace: An animal translator? I have had it up to HERE with stupid animals today! Why would you wanna know what stupid animals are saying? Oh, I can tell you what they'll say: "I'm an animal and I bite my own heinie!" "I've got a small cranial capacity!" "Look at me! I don't have opposable thumbs!" (The animals start to become angry at Candace's statements and begin growling at her) "I eat with my face!" "I sweat through my tongue!" "I'm a furry-flea bitten loser! LIKE ANY OTHER ANIMAL ON THIS PLANET!"
("planet" echoes)
Doberman: (barks into mic)

Doofenshmirtz: Now, Perry the Platypus, with a push of this button, we will move out of the automobile age, and USHER IN THE AGE OF THE BO-AT! I'm driving on water! Look at me! I'm BO-AT-ing! Woo-hoo! Living the dream! Perry the Platypus? How did-- I always forget you are a semi-aquatic mammal. (Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz in the face) 
Candace: MOM! MOM! ANIMALS HATE ME!
Linda: Oh, honey. That's just ridiculous. Perry likes you.
(Animals growling, water floods them away)
Candace: (sighs) Huh. Huh. Never mind. 
(Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz in the face)
Doofenshmirtz: Aah!
(Perry the Platypus Theme instrumental)
Doofenshmirtz: No! Don't open the Metropolitan Oval Aquatic Trench! (moat opens up) No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey, look! It spells "MOAT". I never noticed that before. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! 
Candace: Mom! You're here! Come on, come on! You gotta see this!
Linda: Candace, will you--
Candace: Aha! (gasps) I can't believe it. Everything is still here. There it is! They built an animal translator!
Linda: Oh, that's adorable.
Candace: Wait. No, it is not!
Phineas: Hey, Mom. We built an animal translator. Look!
Candace: See? You're gonna see. It really works! Heeheeheeheehee.
Phineas: Okay, Perry. We've been waiting all day for this.
(Perry chatters)
Translator: (plays back Perry's chatter)
Phineas: Oh, well. I guess it doesn't mean anything.
Linda: Aw, you know he's saying, "You guys are the best!" Now, come on everyone. Inside for some lemonade.
Candace: Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-but... (sighs)
Jeremy: Hey, Candace.
Candace: Jeremy?
Jeremy: Hey, where'd you go?
Candace: Well, I-
Jeremy: I brought you your shoe.
Candace: Oh.
Jeremy: Oh, don't worry. I washed it. Here. Allow me.
(Candace faints)
Jeremy: Uh, Candace? You 'kay?
Candace: (Sighs) Enchanted. 
An asteroid flies by in the night sky. The title in large, green letters wipes in. Camera pans down to the house.)
Man: (on TV) Last night's meteor may not have been as innocent as we thought...
(Camera cuts to the television. A black-and-white movie is playing.)
...look what happened to Dr. Zachary!
(Pulls back curtains to reveal a man's head in a jar.
Phineas and Ferb on the couch watching the film.)
Phineas: (High-fives Ferb) Cool!

(In Candace's room...)
Candace: (Hears the film playing) Now what?

(Walks into the living room)
Alright, what are you guys up to?
Phineas: Watching the Invasion of the Human Overlords marathon. They're playing all five movies tonight!
Candace: Is that all? Pfft.
Well enjoy your lame, colorless marathon. I'm heading back.
(She starts to leave, then looks back at the screen)
Candace: Wait, who's that?!
Phineas: That's Dr. Abernathy. He's a scientist!
Candace: He's kind of hunky for a 50s guy.

"Dr. Abernathy": Don't worry. I'll you keep safe.
Woman: Thanks, doctor, but please call me Amanda.
"Dr. Abernathy": Alright... Amanda. (They kiss)

Candace: Sold! (Quickly sits on the couch) Get me up to speed.
Phineas: The aliens are replacing the heads of all the humans with their own shape-shifting, multi-eyed heads, which can then assume the form of the host human.
Candace: Get out, and then...?
Ferb: Once they replace more than 51% of all the humans, they can assume control the earth for their own nefarious purposes.
Candace: Shut up! And...?
(Perry growls and twitches in his sleep)
Candace: No way! Is there no way to stop them?
Phineas: If only you can catch them if they're in their human state. That's when they're at their weakest.
Candace: Then how you can tell they're aliens?
Phineas: There's three classic ways to spot an alien. First, they have strange vocal patterns. They don't quite get human syntax.

"Dr. Abernathy": Pass me that krie-bop, please.
Amanda: You mean this hammer?
"Dr. Abernathy": Oh, yes, hammer. Krie-bop is what we call it in Ohio... where I'm from.

Candace: What else?
Phineas: They're anatomically disproportionate.

"Dr. Abernathy": Now I need the sprigle-brock.
Amanda: The what?
"Dr. Abernathy": Never mind. I'll get it. (stretches his arm to the back of the machine to get the wrench)

Phineas: But the clear sign is that they can safely remove any human head, and replace it with their own multi-eyed, shape shifting head.
Candace: Well, yeah. I guess that would be a giveaway.
Phineas: (pointing to the TV) Like this.

Amanda: Doctor? What's wrong. Are you alright?
"Dr. Abernathy": Yes, Amanda. I'm fine. We're all fine... (comes out, now with an alien head) ...and soon you will be too!
Amanda: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Alien: Sorry, Amanda, but we've waited long enough.
Amanda: NOOOO!!! (Her head is detached and placed in a jar) This can't be! What's happening? NOOOO!!!
The real Dr. Abernathy: I tried to warn you.

(Later in the evening...Candace is still watching the movie as her brothers are now asleep.)
Amanda: Doctor, your head is attached! You're human again!
Dr. Abernathy: Yes, and once Dr. Zachary returns from heading into those dark, ominous woods alone, with his not fully charged flashlight, you will be too... Amanda. (They kiss)

(As Phineas and Ferb sleep the night away, Candace is still watching the movie, at one point standing on the couch punching at the air. The next morning...)
Amanda: But it was all right here! Oh, why did I think anyone would believe me? I was a fool! (sobs) A fool...!
("THE END?" is displayed over the screen.)
Candace: Oh, my gosh, you guys. That was awesome. Guys? Uh, guys? (Sees they have left the couch) Wow, it's tomorrow already. I gotta find those guys and tell them how it ended. Guys, guys, guys, ugh--

(Candace runs into Linda, who's carrying a laundry basket)
Candace: Sorry, Mom. Have you seen the boys?
Linda: Yeah, I think they're upstairs. Can you do me a favor and take the laundry up? I'm late for an appointment.
Candace: Sure, Mom.
Linda: Thanks, hon. I'll be back.
Candace: (Holding up a t-shirt) Oh, how cute. Ferb's torso is so tiny.
(Upstairs; at Ferb) Oh, there you are. You know, that movie was so...
Ferb's cousin: (on computer; Scottish accent; shouting indistinctly)
Candace: Oops, sorry. I'll just put these in your room.
Ferb's cousin: Oh, I wish you were there, Ferb.
Ferb: So do I. Tell Uncle Angus and Aunt Mora thanks for the candy.
Ferb's cousin: Too late. Scotland out. Peace.

Candace: Oh, hey, Phineas. Oh, my gosh, you missed it. By the end everyone got their heads back and everything went back to normal. Well, sort of. The entire laboratory disappeared. But I loved it. I can't look at anything the same way ever again.
Phineas: Cool, glad you liked it.
Candace: Ooh, I-- I almost forgot the coolest part. (In the backyard) Hey, guys. Guys. You're never gonna believe this. At the end, they- (ominous theme playing) (gasps) Ferb? (sees what looks like Ferb removing his head, she screams and runs to the panic room) Oh, my gosh. Ferb's an alien. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on a second. I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason Ferb can remove his head. I mean, it's not like he had any of the other telltale signs, is it? Oh, no.
(Flashback #1)
Ferb's cousin: (Scottish accent; speaking incoherently)
Candace: Strange vocal patterns...
(Flashback #2)
Past Candace: (Holding up a t-shirt) Oh, how cute. Ferb's torso is so tiny.
Candace: Anatomically disproportionate... (gasps; Flashbacks disappears) THEY GOT TO FERRRRRB!!!!

(Candace runs to Phineas)
Candace: Phineas, Phineas! I-- I know you're gonna think I've completely lost it, but I'm pretty sure that Ferb is an alien. I've got to find his head and re-attach it.
Phineas: My brother's an alien? How cool is that? But I think you may be letting your imagination get the best of you, sis.
Candace: Oh, a non-believer, huh? Well, you know what? I'm gonna get proof. You'll see. Ferb's an alien!
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?

(In Perry's lair)
Major Monogram: Sorry about the distraction, Agent P. The ladies are helping to, uh, (reading from a card) "net-roy-er the lair."
Carl: Très bien, Monsieur Monogram. Très bien.
French Maids: (giggles) Bonjour, Carl.
Carl: Bonjour, Madame.
Maids: (giggles)
Major Monogram: So we're having a bit of a cleanup here, which coincidentally is what Doofenshmirtz seem to be having as well. He's put some old "-inators" up for sale on an evil auction site. If one of those devices were to fall into the wrong hands, it could be catast—
Could—Could you please wait for me to finish, Mimi?
Fifi: Non "Mimi." Fifi.
Major Monogram: Oui, Fifi. (at himself) Oh, now I've lost my train of thought. (at Perry) Anyway, get out to Doof's place and put a stop to it. (at Carl) How much is this costing us, Carl?
Carl: Une petite fortune.
Major Monogram: "Petite." That means small, right? Well done, Carl.

Maids: (giggling)

(closes the door; dramatic music) Behold the Wrapped-Up-in-a-Nice-Little-Bow-Inator. (Perry, disguised as an evil scientist, blinks) I bet you're wondering what it does, huh? Well, let's say your nemesis is arriving sooner than expected and- And your place is a complete mess. (camera pans to a messy "bedroom") Tidying up is a snap (snaps fingers) with the press of this large, red button. (pushes aforesaid button) See? Wrapped up in a nice little bow.

Aw. 
(In Phineas and Ferb's room)
Candace: (giggling) Well, Phineas, what do you think? Wait. Before you say anything, look at these photos. I stalked "Ferb" all day. (shows Phineas some photos) See? Proof positive. Ferb...is an ALIEN.
Phineas: Um, well—
Candace: No, no, no, no, just wait till you see. Here, here.
Phineas: But—
Candace: Here, here.
Phineas: But—
Candace: Here and here. And listen to this: (whirring) See? That is an entirely different silence than the Ferb silence we're used to. Here, I'll pay it backwards. (Whirring)

Candace: Fine. Here, here, wait, what about this hideous ball of goo?
Phineas: Listen, Candace, as cool as it would be for Ferb to be an alien, that's sadly not the case. Here, follow me and I'll show you.
Candace: Wait, show me what? 
(In the backyard)
Phineas: Ferb, old pal, our dear sister here thinks you may be a sinister extraterrestrial visitor.
Candace: I saw Ferb's head ripped off by a hideous alien monster.
Phineas: Oh, you must mean this reverse power coupling unit we're repairing.
Candace: Reverse power coupling unit?
Phineas: Sure. That's all it was. Ferb's no more alien than you or me.
Candace: But—But what about all this evidence I've been collecting?
Phineas: Well, even though Ferb's not an alien, we are fixing a spacecraft for a friend of Meap's.
Candace: Wait, what?

Phineas: No problem, Garbog. I hope you finished your study on the habits of the human female parental unit.
(Ferb gives a thumbs up)
Garbog: (speaks in alien dialect)
(Garbog flies up to the spaceship and flies it out of sight.)
Candace: Uh, I -- I -- (sobbing) 
(A car horn is heard.)
Candace: It's Mom! The real Mom! And I still have proof! (The Linda robot disappears.) Crud. (gasps) But the launch pad is still there! (runs off) 
(At Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.)
(While Doofenshmirtz and Perry were fighting, Perry kicks a box into his mouth. When he removes the bow, everything in the box starts to release.)
Doofenshmirtz: Uh-oh.
(When Doofenshmirtz grows too much, he pushes his inator away. Perry then jumps onto it and escapes.)
Curse you, Perry the Plat- (he groans, then spits out a chair) Why did I ever order such a large bedroom set?
(Perry pushes the button on the Wrapped-Up-in-a-Nice-Little-Bow-Inator and the entire building gets wrapped up in a nice little bow)
(action theme playing)
♪ Agent P! ♪
Ow! Wow, you know, it's quite a bit roomier in here than you'd think.
(When the inator hit the ground, it launches a ray into space, then it reaches a satellite and gets launched back to Earth) 
(In the kitchen)
Candace: Mother? Is that you? I mean, really you?
The real Linda: Candace, I don't have time right now. I have frozens.
Candace: Yep. That's you. (pushes her) Come on, Mom, quick!
(In the backyard)
Phineas: Nice design on that rocket gantry, by the way.
(The ray hits the launch pad and wraps it up in a nice little bow.)
Phineas: And it folds up for easy storage. Cool.
Candace: (With her eyes closed) Please, please, please, please be there...!
Linda: (flatly) And I'm seeing... (her perspective of:) ...the backyard.
Candace: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
(Perry walks up.)
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry.
Candace: (sobs) But it was all right here! Oh, why did I think anyone would believe me? I was a fool! (sobs again) A fool...!
(Just like in the black-and-white movie, "THE END?" is displayed over the screen.) 
(Scene opens up showing Isabella sleeping, then the alarm clock goes off.)
Isabella: There you are, Isabella! (Laughs) I made a funny. It's always humorous when one refers to oneself in the third-person. You try it, Pinky.
(Pinky barks)
Isabella: Yeah, not a hard and fast rule, I guess. What's that? I hear a sash calling me to earn it some more new patches. Come on, Pinky. 
(Scene shifts to the Fireside House)
Gretchen: Sesquipedalian.
(All of the Fireside Girls shrug.)
Milly: Here's your "Saying a Word No One Else in the Room Knows" patch! Does anyone else want to try?
Gretchen: Shh! Someone's coming! Defense positions.
(The Fireside Girls are preparing for defense.)
(Isabella knocks on the door in a pattern.)
Gretchen: Look alive, people! It's our fearless leader.
(Gretchen unbolts the door, Isabella and Pinky enter.)
Isabella: Hey, guys, what'cha doin'?
Holly: Earning patches!
Isabella: So, did you guys decide what patch to get today? 'Cause I have a suggestion!
Adyson: Let me guess. The "Let's Help Phineas and Ferb" patch?
Isabella: It's called the "Help Thy Neighbor" patch, Adyson. Don't make up patch names.
(Cut to Milly and Ginger, who raises her hand.)
Ginger: I already have 52 of those.
Milly: I have 53. Remember, I went back one afternoon after everyone else went home.
Isabella: I know. Don't remind me.
Gretchen: You just want an excuse to see Phineas.
Isabella: The very thing I live for.
Adyson: All right, then! Let's go see what Phineas and Ferb are doing!
Ginger: Why don't we ever go see what Baljeet is doing?
Milly: Because we've done that before.
Holly: Yeah, and that patch wasn't worth it.
Isabella: Hey, where's Pinky? 
(Scene shifts to Pinky, who jumps from behind a bush wearing a fedora to enter a hidden elevator. It's full, so he takes the second one and salutes Agent P on the way down.)
Wanda Acronym: Hello, Agent Pinky. Professor Poofenplotz has been making a barrage of inquiries about hairspray, of all things. It's all very suspicious. Suss it out and put the kibosh on it.
(Pinky barks) 
(Scene shifts to the Danville Park)
Isabella: Hey, guys. Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Well, to be perfectly honest, I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I've been doing. Always getting so wrapped up in these silly projects that I don't care about. It's you I care about, Isabella! (changes into a centaur and Isabella rides off on him) Can we be together forever and ever?
Isabella: Yeah! We can definitely do that.
Phineas: Excellent. (Record scratches and Isabella's fantasy fades away) While they're getting that, we can finish our designs on the transponder. See you girls back at the field.
Isabella: Okay, Phineas! Oh, my gosh. What did he say? What does he need? (Sighs) I was in Phineasland again.
Gretchen: We'll explain on the way, Chief. Right now, we have to find the rare maracanut tree, and earn our "Sap Collecting" patch.
(Camera pans to Milly and Ginger. Ginger earns herself the "I Just Saw a Cute Boy" patch.)
Milly: What's that patch for?
Ginger: It's the "I Just Saw a Cute Boy" patch.
Milly: Where?
Ginger: Duh! (points to Baljeet) That one over there with the color-coded schedule.
(A beat, then Milly rips the patch off.)

(Pinky arrives) Pinky the Chihuahua! So you thought you can sneak up on me? Stop shaking, you jittery little pest. (Holds Pinky, and shakes. She doesn't shake anymore after releasing.) Anyway. I woke up from my beauty sleep and thought to myself, "What the heck? Why not try to take over the world again?" But, as you know, Pinky, I can't very well take over the world until I'm drop-dead gorgeous! But I can't make myself beautiful, because I ran out of my favorite hair spray. It went a little something like this.
(Flashback)
Worker: Can I help you with something, ma'am?
Poofenplotz: Yes. Can you tell me where you've moved your Stiff Beauty hair spray?
Worker: Oh, I'm so sorry, ma'am. That product has been discontinued. As it turns out, only amusement park clowns used it. And ever since the old amusement park shut down, Stiff Beauty hasn't been selling.
Poofenplotz: Discontinued?
Worker: Discontinued.
Poofenplotz: So what you're saying is Stiff Beauty's no longer going to be sold.
Worker: Right. That's what "discontinued" means.
Poofenplotz: (after a pause) How about I discontinue YOU from this dimension!
(Eerie theme)
Worker: This so isn't worth minimum wage.
(Flashback ends)
Poofenplotz: The only supply of Stiff Beauty left in the world is at the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park. And I intend to use my Me-Mobile to get me there!
(Robot arm drops Pinky in a trash can)
(Trash can Clanging/Rattling) 
(Scene shifts to the Fireside Girls)
Gretchen: According to this Fireside Girls book on dendrology, the maracanut tree is indigenous to mountain valley micro-climates. So it looks like we're heading in the right direction.
(Hard rock theme)
(Didgeridoo humming)
Isabella: Hi. Excuse me. Um, hello. Earth to hippie. (Imitates Didgeridoo reverb) Excu-u-u-u-u-u-use Me-e-e-e-e-e-e.
The Guru: Whoa! You just harmonized with me.
Fireside Girls: Oooh!
Isabella: Would you possibly know where the maracanut trees might be located?
The Guru: Indeed, I do, my formidable little flower. Behold. (Shows tree stumps)
Isabella: Oh, no! What happened? Where did they all go?
The Guru: They were all chopped down so their sap could be used for... (Tears up) ...hair spray. Such a shame.
Isabella: So, there aren't any left?
The Guru: Don't fret, my pet. There happens to be one sole maracanut tree left in existence. It's at the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park over on the next hill.
Isabella: Did you just say "the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park"?
The Guru: Yes. The old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park.
Isabella: "Old abandoned" twice?
The Guru: Yes.
Isabella: All right.
The Guru: Step up, little sister. Let me bestow upon you the Key of Wisdom. (Drops key) Bask in its glory!
(Song stops. It is a car key on a peace sign key chain.)
The Guru: Cool, huh?
Isabella: Um...
(The Guru disappears in a cloud of smoke)
Fireside Girls: He's gone!
Adyson: Wow.
Gretchen: No, he's not. He's right over there. (Points to The Guru, trying to make an escape quietly)
The Guru: Oh, uh... Hey! hey, hi... Hey, little sisters. See you on the flip side! 
(Scene shifts to Candace and Linda)
Candace: So, Mom, am I doing great or what?
Linda: Well, "Or what." Candace. Trash cans!
(Candace runs into some trash cans, which knocks them over.)
(Pinky puts on his jet-pack and then leaves) 
(Scene shifts to the Fireside Girls, who arrived at "The old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park")
Isabella: Well, here we are, I guess. Oh, I get it! It was actually called "The Old Abandoned Amusement Park"! And now it's old and abandoned. Hence, "old abandoned" twice. Girls, we're goin' in. We've got a tree to find! (The girls race to various attractions in the park) Fireside Girls, report!
Katie: Nothing up here, Captain!
Gretchen: Ditto, Chief!
Holly: It just smells like feet in here.
Ginger: These clown lockers are just full of cheap hair spray!
Isabella: It has to be around here somewhere. Creepy roadside hippie gurus are generally reliable. Wait, I think I found it! (Points at a tall ride in the back of the park)
(The Fireside Girls gasp and run over to it)
Ginger: Yeah!
Milly: I think you're right, Chief.
Adyson: This should be it.
Gretchen: This must be it, Chief. I think you're right.
Isabella: (Reading a placard near the ride) "Stickiness is the most underrated of all the -nesses, and of all the stickinesses, the sap of the maracanut tree is the sticky-messiest. This Temple of Sap attraction is a monument to the rare and beautiful maracanut tree, the world's greatest stickerizer." Looks like we've tracked our quarry to its lair, girls! Although, if their biggest attraction was a sap-themed ride, I understand why this place closed down. Girls, get your gear. We're climbin' up.
Holly: Probably not a good idea. (Punches the wall of the ride) The whole thing's structurally unsound.
(The ride begins to fall apart; a big piece detaches completely)
Adyson: Look out!
(The piece of the ride is headed straight for Holly. She runs to safety)
(Holly screams)
(The girls all run over to Isabella)
Adyson: The whole place will fall!
Gretchen: And there's no way to get that tree! 
(Song: "The Fireside Girls")
Isabella: Calm down, girls. Have you forgotten who we are? We're Fireside Girls Troop 46321, and we never give up!
All: ♪ We're Fireside Girls, one and all ♪
♪ And together we belong! ♪
♪ We wear our patches upon our sashes ♪

Isabella: So, let's procure the sap for Phineas!
Fireside Girls: Yay, Phineas!
Isabella: Oh, and Ferb too!
Fireside Girls: And Ferb too!
Ginger: And Baljeet!
(She is wearing the "I Just Saw A Cute Boy" patch again. Katie rips it off of her sash.)
Isabella: Well, the old hippie didn't mention how to get to the top of that, all he gave us was this Key of Wisdom.
(Isabella presses the peace sign on the key chain. The unlocking noise of a car is heard in the distance. Then the camera zooms in on an old 60s minibus precariously balanced at the peak of the roller coaster.)
Adyson: Groovy!
Katie: Dy-no-mite!
Milly: Far out!
Gretchen: Jinkies! (Pinky is seen flying through downtown Danville via jet-pack. He flies into Poofenplotz's Me-Mobile through its temple.)
Poofenplotz: Pinky the Chihuahua! Well, Momma knows haw to deal with bad little doggies!
(A newspaper springs up out of the floor and begins smacking Pinky over the head.)
Poofenplotz: Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad do...
(The newspaper flies across the room, landing in her mouth. Pinky shoots a grappling hook out the hole he created into the side of a nearby building. The Me-Mobile struggles to free itself.) 
(Isabella peers into the van)
Isabella: Well, there's no engine, but it looks like gravity will do the trick.
(They all look at the tree, about a hundred feet away)
Isabella: All right, girls. Are we ready to get that "Reckless Disregard for Life and Limb" patch?
Fireside Girls: Aye-aye, Captain!
(The girls climb into the van and buckle their seat-belts)
Isabella: All right, ladies! Lean!
Fireside Girls: Lean!
(They all scream as the van rolls down the roller coaster track. It propels them back up into the air like a ski jump once the track ends.)
Gretchen: So, how exactly is this gonna work?
(Isabella blanks, then becomes visibly worried.)
Isabella: Girls, sashes! Now!
(The Fireside Girls tie their sashes together to form a rope, which Isabella fastens to her waist. She climbs onto the roof.)
Isabella: Gretchen, you have the controls.
Gretchen: What good will that do?!
Isabella: Just trust me!
(Isabella does a swan dive off the roof of the van. Grabbing the tree from the top of the ride, she somersaults up into the back of the van as Milly and Katie open the door for her. She holds the tree up in triumph.)
Isabella: Oh, my goodness, what a cute little tree!
Milly and Katie: Aww.
Gretchen: Isabella? What now? We're gonna CRAAAASH!!!
Isabella: Oh, no, we're not. Everybody... lean! (They all lean on the port side of the van, causing it to spiral down to the ground. As it lowers, it snaps the wire on Pinky's grappling hook. The van lands successfully on the ground. The Fireside Girls cheer.)
(The Me-Mobile somersaults all the way to the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park. Professor Poofenplotz lands right in the clown locker room.) 
(While driving through Danville...)
Isabella: Okay, girls. It's time to tap that sap!
Katie: I'm on it!
Holly: Hold it still, Katie. (She captures the sap in a test tube) We got it, Isabella! 
(The van breaks through the wall surrounding the park. It drives right over to where Phineas and Ferb are standing. Isabella somersaults out the back, stands up, and gracefully hands Phineas the vial of sap.)
Isabella: Hey, Phineas. We got that sap you guys needed.
Phineas: Excellent, Isabella! That's the last ingredient we need. (Isabella looks delighted) Now all we have to do is... (changes into a centaur) run away together.
(Isabella's vision from earlier returns, until Gretchen shakes her.)
Gretchen: Isabella? (Record scratch) Isabell-a? Phineas said, "Thanks."
Isabella: "Thanks." He really does appreciate me.
Gretchen: (Pushing the infatuated Isabella off-screen) Yes. Yes, he does. 
(In the clown locker room, Professor Poofenplotz raises her head. The first thing she sees are hundreds of bottles of hair spray.)
♪ Stiff Beauty! ♪
Poofenplotz: Yes! At last, my own lifetime supply of Stiff BEAUTY!!!!!
(She sings the last word so loudly that the Temple of Sap ride falls over and crushes the clown locker room. The aerosol cans explode, coating her in hair spray. It is so thick that she cannot move.)
Poofenplotz: (through gritted teeth) I may be stiff, but at least I'm beautiful.
(Part of her hair kinks and stand straight up.)
Poofenplotz: Curse you, Pinky the Chihuahua! 
(Scene opens at the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Phineas: So, what's the plan today, Dad?
Lawrence: Well, your mother's jazz trio has a gig at the Mayor's Day festivities, and I shall be running the antiques auction, oh yes! I'm very excited because we have a collection of steamrollers on the block, all imported from England.
Candace: You're kidding. There's a market for that?
Lawrence: Oh, you'd be surprised, what with Steamroller Today magazine and Wacky Steamroller videos posted on the Internet. The public is going crazy for the flattening arts.
Candace: Pfff. People and their silly trends. (to Linda) Hey, Mom, can I get a pink streak in my hair?
Linda: Why would you do that?
Candace: To express my individuality! Everyone's doing it!
Linda: No! (to Lawrence) Alright, well, I'm all set. I've got my lucky guitar strings, wearing my lucky underwear, and, of course, I've got...
(She digs a golden guitar pick out of her pocket, but it goes flying through the air and slides into the crack between floor and wall)
Linda: Oh, no! My lucky gold guitar pick! (Gets down on all fours to peer into the crack) It's wedged in the wall.
Lawrence: Oh, here. Try my lucky butter knife.
(He hands the knife to Linda and she pokes it into the crack, but it's too short)
Linda: Oh, it's too far in. (Stands) You gave me that for our anniversary.
Lawrence: Oh, don't worry, love. I'll get a contractor in here to retrieve it.
Linda: I hate the idea of someone cutting a hole in my nice wall. Well, I can't worry about it right now. I've got music to make!
Lawrence: Whoa, yes, we'd better go. See you kids at the festival later, okay?
Linda: Bye!
Phineas/Candace: Good luck!
Phineas: I know what we're gonna do today, Ferb! Hey! Where's Perry?
(Perry sneaks into the kitchen and spits into a spitoon vase.)
Computer: Computer authorizing DNA, one moment please. Access granted.
(Agent P arrives in the lair)
Major Monogram: Morning, Agent P. How do you like the new spitoon lair entrance? (Beat) Anyway, your mission. Mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz is being honored today with a statue at the Mayor's Day Festival. (Background of screen becomes a weather map with Heinz's and Roger's faces on it.) Considering Doofenshmirtz's hatred for his brother, the forecast suggests mild tomfoolery with a sixty percent chance of slapstick violence. Good luck, Agent P. Now on to Tom Perkins with sports.
(In the garage. Ferb is holding a silver ball. Isabella, Baljeet, and Buford enter)
Phineas: We're done, Ferb.
Isabella: Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: We just built a device that temporarily scrambles your molecules so you can pass through solid objects. Let's see if it works.

Candace: So I asked Jeremy if he was going to the festival and he's like "Yeah, are you going to the festival?" and then I go...
(She notices Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet, and Buford staring at the blank wall that Phineas passed through)
Candace: Hey...
Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet, Buford: (without looking around) Hey.

Candace: (takes out phone and dials) Mom?
Linda: (on stage at the festival) Hello? Candace?
Candace: Mom, I know this sounds crazy. I mean, no crazier than all my other calls. You've got a gig, you're upset about losing your lucky pick. Like, you're going to come home now and see what I'm rambling on about. No, you know, I should bring the ball to you! Yeah that's a good idea. Mom, forget this call ever happened. Bye! (hangs up)

Doofenshmirtz: Those are my keys, aren't they? (On the phone) No, I don't have my card. Yes, the keys are still in there and it's running. (Engine shudders to a stop.) Okay, now it's not running; now I need gas... Forty-five minutes huh?... (Sighs) Well I'm not going anywhere. (Puts phone away) Eh, well at least I can get my -inator. (Aims the -inator.)
Roger Doofenshmirtz: As we get closer to unveiling this perfect replica of my body...

Doofenshmirtz: What? That's a... it's an arts and crafts project! I've got a life outside of you!

Doofenshmirtz: Curse you Perry the bobblehead!
(Phineas, Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet, Buford biking to the festival. Isabella slows down.)
Isabella: Oh no! Bummer, I have a flat!
Phineas: No problem, we can fix it.

Lawrence: And now, ladies and gentlemen, what you've all been waiting to bid on. I give you, the antique steamrollers! (crowd cheers)
Crowd member: They're so beautiful! (cries)
Wilbur Wilkins: Steamrollers stink!
Orville Wilkins: Yeah, pump trolleys rule!
Old lady: (gasps) It's the Wilkins brothers!
Old man: Just ignore them Arlene. They try to cause trouble at every steam-powered antique auction in the Tri-State Area.

How do you like me now Perry the Gone-a-pus?
(Perry dodges and the Be-Gone-Inator disintegrates a tree.)
Doofenshmirtz: Eh, so I missed. Oh whatever, I have a bigger bother to be-gone. Goodbye, stupid Roger statue!
(Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz out of the seat and moves the Be-Gone-Inator; the beam hits a House of Mirrors and bounces around the mirrors.)
Lawrence: And Lot Number 2 is a little beaut from Aveling & Porter built in 1924. Do I have any bids?
Crowd: I do! I do! I do! Here!
Orville Wilkins: Nobody's paying a lick of attention to us Wilbur.
Wilbur Wilkins: Yeah! Let's get out of here.
(The pump-trolley grazes against a steamroller and the steamroller starts rolling backward off the hill towards where Ferb is pumping Isabella's bike's tire)
Baljeet: (Impatiently) So how long does it take you to fix a flat? Tick tock!
Candace: (Running through the festival) Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through!
(Candace trips on a rock, falls into a porta potty door, and is stuck with her head and one hand through the door. The phase ball flies out of her hand. Cut back to the bottom of the hill with Phineas, Ferb, Isabella, Buford, and a visibly impatient Baljeet as the steamroller approaches them. The group is oblivious to the machine as they remain fixated on Ferb re-inflating Isabella's tire.)
Baljeet: Aghh! You can build a rollercoaster in a day, but it takes you 12 minutes to pump up a tire?
(Phase ball bumps into the group and the incoming steamroller phases through them.)
Baljeet: Did anybody else just see the inside of a steamroller?
Buford: How do you know what the inside of a steamroller looks like?
Baljeet: I have a life outside of you!
Phineas: Well, the tire's fixed.
(The group bikes away. The steamroller rolls back up the hill to its original Lot position, crushing the phase ball in the process)
Lawrence: And Lot Number 5 is sold to the woman in red. And now the last item of the day: we have Lot 6. Do I have any bids?
Candace: (struggling to get the door off of the porta potty stall, while Balthazar gives her a high five) Mom!
(Candace runs off with the door still stuck around her neck)
Candace: Mom!
(Doofenshmirtz tackles Perry out of the Be-Gone-Inator's seat. The Be-Gone-Inator beam bounces off the rearview mirror of the flatbed and disintegrates itself.)
Doofenshmirtz: Hmm... what are the odds?
Phineas: Hey mom! I'm glad we caught you. Ferb and I found your lucky gold pick.
Linda: Oh boys! Thank you! What a relief; I just hate playing without it.
Candace: Mom! Mom! Look at this! Look at me!
Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro: Linda! We're on!
Candace: Mom!
Linda: Candace, I've gotta go. And just because I won't let you get pink hair, you don't have to wear some weird door. The trends these days...

Candace: Oh no! Jeremy!
Jeremy: You seen Candace?
Phineas: She's standing in the door.
Jeremy: Thanks.
Candace: Oh no! Oh no! Jeremy can't see me like this. Oh my g..! Oh no! (winds the door's toilet paper around her head)

Jeremy: Candace?
Candace: ...and four. And breathe. Whew, just doing some stretching. Oh hi Jeremy!
Jeremy: So, our moms are going to start playing when they unveil the statue. Wanna go?
Candace: (dreamily) Sure.
Roger Doofenshmirtz: And now, without further ado! (Statue is unveiled; crowd cheers; band starts playing.)
Phineas: Well Ferb, it looks like everything worked out for everyone today.
Doofenshmirtz: (standing with Perry on his flatbed, balanced on the edge of the cliff) I can't believe nothing worked out for me today. After... I.. I had a A, B, and C and they all... 'course I destroyed the B so...
(Perry jumps off. The flatbed tilts and rolls down the cliff with Doofenshmirtz on it.)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey where are you going? Curse you Perry the Platypus! (Rolls past the Wilkins brothers)
Wilbur Wilkins: Hey look at that! A pump-less pump trolley!
Orville Wilkins: Now that's old school. 
(Scene opens up in the Flynn-Fletcher living room. Candace, Phineas, Ferb and Perry are watching television)
Narrator: This week, we ask "Where Did They Go?" about Pop Stars from the 80's... First up, this perky pop-star stole a One Wonder Hit by declaring "I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun."
Candace: Hey, she looks familiar.
Narrator: Lindana's real name is Linda Flynn-Fletcher and she's now living in the Tri-State Area.
Candace: What? Mom, mom, mom!
Phineas: I can't believe she didn't know that.
(Candace then runs to Linda)
Candace: Mom, mom, mom, mom! You never told me you were a pop star!
Linda: Oh yeah! Well, that was long before you were born. It was fun, but I was happy to give it up to raise a family.
Candace: But you were Lindana and you wanted to have fun!
Linda: Well, now I'm Linda and I wanna stir broth.
Phineas: (holding a cell phone) Mom, it's for you. He says he's a concert promoter.
Linda: Really? 
(Screen switches to Linda on the phone)
Linda: An '80's revival concert featuring Lindana? Well, I don't know.
Candace: Are you crazy?!? Say yes!!!
Linda: Candace, it's been so long.
Candace: Come on! It'll be fun! And you'll be cool! And by extension, I'll be cool! (She smiles.)
Linda: Oh, what the heck? (on phone) I'll do it!
Candace: (jumping) Woohoo!
Phineas: Way to go, Mom!
(Ferb holds up a sparkler.)
Lawrence: Yes, oh, yes, good on ya, honey. (chuckles) 
(Screen switches to Linda in a limo talking to her husband and sons)
Linda: Okay, then, dinner's in the oven. Just heat it up. Bye!
(She waves and rolls the window up while Lawrence waves back.)
Candace: (popping out of the sunroof with her fists in the air) Rock and roll!
(The limo drives away.)
Lawrence: Oh, I was afraid that a day like today would come someday...today.
Phineas: Whadaya mean, Dad?
Lawrence: Oh, your mother's going to meet a lot of exciting and cool people. What if I'm...I'm no longer cool enough for your mum? I'm hardly a rock star, am I? (walking away sadly) I"m afraid I'm hopelessly nerdy.
Phineas: (to his stepbrother) You know, Dad may be a little geeky for the new century, but in the '80s, the rise of the synthesizer allowed even hopeless nerds to rock the charts.
Ferb: Phineas, I know what we're going to do today!
Phineas: Yes. Yes, you do. Hey, where's Perry? 
(Cut to Perry on the couch. He puts on his fedora. The sofa cushion flips and he goes under. Cut to Agent P's lair. Some loose change and cash falls out of the chute followed by Agent P.)
Major Monogram: Ah, Agent P, there you are. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been spotted playing with a hoop. See what he's up to. (Perry looks scornfully at Monogram.) That's it. That's all we got.
(Agent P straps on a backpack. A spring emerges from under his chair and he launches up out of the cellar doors and into the sky. He presses a button and his hang-glider is released from the backpack. He ejects from the hang-glider into D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus, (hula hooping) as you can see I've been struck by hooping fever. Go ahead, try it. (Perry starts hooping) Like this, yeah. Now do this, with your arms down. (Perry does so and the hoop traps him.) Oh, finally! My hips were about to fall off. Behold, the Alien-inator! It's a projector that will transmit holographic images of space aliens onto the steps of the Tri-State Capital. Then, when everyone is scared witless, I will emerge in my king of the aliens costume and seize control of the entire Tri-State Area. Hee hee! I'm gonna go put it on. 
(Cut to Linda and Lawrence's bedroom.)
Phineas: Ladies and gentlemen, presenting that '80s superstar, Max Modem!
(Cut to a closet door with a silhouetted Lawrence. Lights up on Lawrence who is now in a blond wig, wearing a dark pair of shades and in a cyan-shaded jumpsuit with the letter "M" on it, a belt also with the letter "M" on it, white gloves, and black boots.)
Lawrence/Max: You know, I feel strangely comfortable like this. But how can I be a rock star if nobody's ever heard of me?
Phineas: We're not trying to make you into a rock star. We're trying to make you into a has-been. That's much easier. 
(Cut to an exterior shot of Danville Arena.)
Stage Manager: (offscreen) Can I have Bag Your Face onstage for your sound check, please?
(Cut to backstage where Linda and Candace walk in.)
Candace: Mom, this is so cool! I've dressed like half of these people here for Halloween! So what do we do now?
Linda/Lindana: If I remember correctly: hair, makeup, wardrobe and a photo session.
Candace: A photo session?!
(They walk into a door with the sign "MAKEUP TALENT ONLY" on it.)
Linda/Lindana: The life of a rock star. Oh, it does have it's charms. 
Montage: While "I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun!" plays in the background, Candace and Linda get made up. The scene transitions into a photo session. We then see Linda signing the photos of herself and Candace as Lindana. Candace then adds "'s daughter" and a heart to the signatures. 
(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz's lab.)
Doofenshmirtz: Are you ready? Don't peek. (Doofenshmirtz appears wearing an alien costume with a small crown on its head, a cape, and an inexplicable tan.) Ta-da! What, nothing? Wow, tough room. 
(Cut to the Flynn-Fletcher garage. Phineas and Max Modem are standing with synthesizers.)
Phineas: Okay, Dad, show me what you got.
Lawrence/Max: Right ho!
(Max plays an organ riff.)
Phineas: Woah! Cut cut cut! That's a little too '70s for the '80s. Just check out Ferb.
(Cut to Ferb standing in front of three synthesizers, a synth-pad drum kit, and a sound mixing board. He pushes a button and a bass riff plays.)
Phineas: See, Dad? It's cool to show no effort. Let the technology and machines do the work. (All three push a button on their synths adding to the bass) Primo, Dad! I think you're ready for the big time!
Lawrence/Max: Correction: I am ready to have once been part of the big time. 
(Cut back to Danville Arena. The doors open and Max Modem appears with Phineas and Ferb dressed as his security.)
(Song: "What Do It Do?" (instrumental))
Phineas: Make way for Max Modem!
Man #1: Max Modem?
Man #2: Never heard of him.
Man #3: Didn't he do that song?
Woman #1: Yeah, yeah, yeah! I love that song!
Man #4: Oh, I think I had one of his 45s!
Woman #2: I had all his albums!
Man #5: How did he ever land here!
Woman #3: I sang backup for him in Prague!
All: (chanting) Modem! Modem! Modem! Modem!
(Candace and Lindana follow them.)
Candace: Mom, who is that guy?
Lindana: I don't know, but he does seem kind of familiar in a nerdy sort of way. 
(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz and Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: Alright, Perry the Platypus, (leading his nemesis to the inator) let's start by placing you right here. There you go. And then, I'll set the timer here. Mustn't forget to open the roof; (cut to an exterior shot of D.E.I. as the roof opens) a little something we learned from the Diarrhea-inator debacle. Right, Perry the Platypus? And set the timer for ten minutes so I can get to the steps of the Tri-State Capital building in time to lead my alien army! Ha! Oh, and don't get any bright ideas about thwarting me while I'm gone, because this inator, it's got a few tricks up its sleeve. 
(Cut to the stage of Danville Arena. The crowd can be heard chanting "Lindana!". Cut to the stage. Lindana is bringing her daughter onstage next to her backup singers.)
Candace: But I should be in the wings, Mom. The show's about to start.
Lindana: I wouldn't be here without you, honey. You backed me up all the way. So it's only right that you should back me up onstage.
Candace: Me? Sing?
Lindana: Just relax. You'll do fine.
(Candace gives a thumbs up as the band cues up her hit and the curtain opens.)

(The three go behind the curtain, but not before Max takes one last peek at his wife singing.) 
(Cut to Danville City Hall. Doofenshmirtz flies down in his rocket-powered jet skiff.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, good, I'm early! And a killer parking space, too! Score! Time to set up.
Passerby: Nutjob.
Doofenshmirtz: Now let's see. Take over the Tri-State Area speech, and water, in case I get parched during my maniacal rant. Hee hee. Loud-inator. (He gets up on a literal soap box and turns on his loud-inator.) Check, one, two, three.
Sally: Papa, Papa, I wanna see the clown!
Sally's Father: Sally, he's no clown. He's a nutjob.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, ha ha ha! Laugh it up now! A-And when your friends ask what happened to Casual Fridays, you can tell them you opened your big mouth! 
(Cut back to Danville Arena.)
Lindana: Good night, Danville!
Candace: I can't believe I sang backup for Lindana!
Lindana: You can call me "Mom".
Candace: I just sang backup for Mom. Nah, just doesn't have the same ring. 
(Cut to the roof of D.E.I. Perry finds the remote to his trap and disables it. He gets in a fighting position but the inator produces a boxing glove and hits him.)
Alien-inator: I am programmed to defend myself against all attacks. You cannot defeat me, Perry the Platypus. Time is up.
(The inator activates. Cut back to the nutjob known as Doofenshmirtz.)
Doofenshmirtz: Elected officials of the Tri-State Area, look to the skies in horror! (The "aliens" arrive) You are being invaded from space by invaders from space! And I, the King of the Aliens, am here to accept your unconditional surrender!
Man: I though he was a nutjob!
Woman: Me, too!
Doofenshmirtz: Now bow down before me. Bow down and I will spare your menial jobs!
Man 2: Do we get to keep our healthcare benefits? 
(Cut back to Danville Arena. Lindana and Candace see Max walk by with Phineas and Ferb dressed as robots.)
Stage Manager: (offscreen) Thirty seconds, Mr. Modem.
Lindana: Who is that guy?
Candace: You know, he really does look familiar.
Lindana: Yes. Yes, he does.

(Cut back to Perry)
Alien-inator: Dr. Doofenshmirtz has programmed me with all of his vast knowledge of you. Your secret agent skills are useless. (Agent P thinks for a moment, then takes off his fedora and goes into mindless pet mode and chatters.) Perry the Platypus, where did you go? I was not informed that your agency had developed a cloaking device. Here, Perry. Perry. Come to— (Perry jumps on the inator toppling it over. The "aliens" disappear.)
Man: Look! The aliens are disappearing!
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, great. Now I am a nutjob.

We're Max Modem and the Mainframes! Thank you, Tri-State Area! 
(Max leaves the stage and approaches Lindana.)
Lindana: Nice work, "Max." You've still got it. Although I can't say I remember you having it in the first place.
Max Modem: You weren't so bad yourself. What say we go out for a spot of tea sometime?
Linda: Oh, no thanks. I've got an absolutely wonderful husband back home.
Max Modem: (removing his shades) Yeah, well, you better believe it, Ducky.
Lindana: (embracing her husband) But what did you do all this for?
Max Modem: I just thought you might like it if I were a bit more exciting.
Lindana: Oh, Lawrence, you and the kids are all the excitement I could ever want.
Phineas: (holding the phone) Mom, it's the promoter again! He wants to sign you and Max Modem for an extended tour!
Lindana: Tell him thanks but no thanks.
Candace: WHAT?!?! But what about the coolness, the fame and the fortune?!
Max Modem: Oh, Candace, we don't need those things to be happy.
Lindana: All we need is you guys.
Phineas: Right. Who wants to go on tour when there's so much to do around here this summer?
Candace: Oh, okay. (Agent P jet packs his way down behind her, takes off his fedora and goes back into mindless pet mode.) But if anyone calls offering me a concert deal I'm takin' it!
Phineas: So, Mom, after all these years, how'd you keep your voice in such great shape?
Lindana: Oh, I was lip-synching. Even back then! (Perry chatters) Oh, there you are, Perry! 

(Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Phineas: Ah, summer. Sunny, warm, some might say hot, it sure would be nice to cool off for a bit. Any ideas? (Ferb takes out a map of Antarctica) Well, while a visit to Antarctica does sound cool, I was thinking of a traditional family Christmas special.
Director: All right, people, let's move in. Move in! All right, lights, camera, sweaters. Can't have Christmas without sweaters! And... cue snow! 
(Song: We Wish You A Merry Christmas (instrumental))
Man: (shakes box of fake snow)
Phineas: That's more like it! Hit it, fellas!

Narrator: Ladies and gentlemen, it's the 12th annual Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas! Brought to you by Wintobreath toothpaste! Now with more inert ingredients. Tonight, celebrate the holidays with Phineas, Ferb, and the whole Flynn-Fletcher family! With Isabella! Buford and Baljeet! Famous singer Kelly Clarkson! And now your hosts: Phineas and Ferb!

Isabella: Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Why, it's Isabella!
Isabella: You know what I love best about this time of year?
Phineas: No, tell us!

Isabella: Extras!
Extra: Not me, I've got a speaking part. But it's just this line. So it's pretty much over now.
Candace: And where did you get those ugly sweaters?
Old Woman: (knitting a sweater) Hey!
Phineas: It's Christmas, Candace!
Candace: It's the middle of summer.
Phineas: Well, no sense waiting 'till the last minute.
Candace: Wait, (grabbing the "camera") are you guys taping this?
Phineas: Actually, we're live.
Candace: This is on TV right now?
Phineas: Yup.
Candace: (turns on TV) Ee-ee-ee-ee... (the TV echoes her giggle and line) I have to make a phone call. (runs off-screen)
Phineas: Candace Flynn, everyone! Up next is our good friend—Hey, where is Perry? 
Major Monogram: I'm sorry, Agent P. Carl's an extra in some Christmas show, and I don't know what Doof is doing today. You know what, I'm just gonna send you over there blind. (salutes) Good luck.

Linda: I think there's a whole wall of them behind me.
Candace: Would you turn around and look at the TVs?
Linda: Okay.

Narrator: Tonight's special is brought to you by the good folks at Wintobreath toothpaste!
Linda: Oh, you're right, Candace. We do need toothpaste. Thanks for reminding me.
Candace: Oh, wait wait, no, aw! 
Lawrence: Oh, how nice! A traditional Christmas special. As my Granddad used to say: "Lung me yellum reek and wits fulgey an'ool bool bay-a!!"
Isabella: What does that mean?
Lawrence: Well, hopefully something festive.
Candace: You too, Dad?
Lawrence: Merry Christmas, everybody! 
Doofenshmirtz: (pauses broadcast) Wait, w-w-what's going on here? Is it Christmas already? What happened to fall? I'm totally unprepared. I-I got to get my yuletide on, and fast! 
Isabella: What's wrong, Phineas? You don't look very happy for Christmas Eve.
Phineas: Everyone's come together for the holidays, but Perry's still not here.
Isabella: He knows it's not really Christmas, right?
Ferb: Every family Christmas special needs a little false drama.
Isabella: Ah!
(door knocking)
Phineas: Who could that be?
Ferb: (opens door)
Phineas: It's famous singer Kelly Clarkson!
(crowd cheering)
Kelly Clarkson: Happy holidays, everyone!
Isabella: Oh, Kelly Clarkson, can you sing us a song?
Kelly Clarkson: Oh, you guys don't wanna hear me sing. (all clamoring) Well, I don't really have anything prepared...
Phineas: Oh, that's too bad. Well, have a seat. We'll have someone else sing.

But I have a solution: (Pulls tarp) The Transport-inator! (ominous music plays) To instantly transport me to the stores while everyone else is circling around looking for a parking spot. I-It's not exactly evil, but it's slightly unfair. Let the last minute shopping begin! (activates the Transport-inator; he disappears and the -inator fires a laser) 
Phineas: Hey! Who's that coming down the chimney?

(Doofenshmirtz disappears from the checkout counter)
Cashier: (into intercom) Customer vaporization in aisle 4. 
Doofenshmirtz: (back at D.E.I.; Perry has pressed the -inator's reverse button) A reverse button? Really? I guess you think you're pretty clever. (Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz, who reels him in with the wrapping paper shooter; Perry winds his wrapping paper around Doof's legs, tearing the paper and falling near a pile of fruitcakes. Perry uses his free tail to launch fruitcakes at Doofenshmirtz) Not fruitcake! (The first one misses; the second hits Doof in the mouth, and he falls down. The next three hit the Transport-inator, causing it to spark and activate. Perry jumps into the Transport-inator's beam and disappears) Now where did he go? 
Phineas: Well, still no sign of Perry, but we're running out of time! Perhaps we should open our presents. (the beam enters the cabin's window and hits a present; Phineas opens that present to reveal Perry) Hey, look, everybody! It's Perry! We're all together after all. This is the best Christmas ever!

Norm: Good morning, sir!
Doofenshmirtz: Ugh.
Norm: (Takes the egg carton and spills the eggs onto a pan) One egg or two?
Doofenshmirtz: None! I don't like them the way you cook 'em. You always leave in the shells! Who does that?
Norm: (Tosses the eggs) I like mine crunchy. (The eggs land on the pan, showing its components scattered on the stove. Doofenshmirtz's laptop beeps)
Doofenshmirtz: Just keep quiet over there. I got a call from Rodney. (Doofenshmirtz answers) What do you want, Rodney?
Rodney: I thought I'd share with you the progress on my new Super Zap-Inizer. (Turns the webcam) My son, Orville, helped me. He's a true evil genius. (Turns the webcam back to himself) I'm so glad I have a son who can assist me in my work and help me become a better evil scientist, instead of a daughter who can, (Sniffs) I don't know, go shopping, I guess? Is that what it's like, Heinz?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh that's ridiculous, Rodney. (Stammers) What you'd have me believe is that daughters (Vanessa walks in) are useless, and if only I had a son instead of a daughter, I'd be much more successful, and my life would be so much better. (Notices Vanessa, who walks off) Wait—No, Vanessa— (Gets up) No, wait—Wait! How long have you been standing there—Vanessa? (Vanessa walks into a room) Vanessa, honey! Oh I can't believe that she would think that I— (Walks back to the desk) I mean, it sure would be nice to have a son in addition. (Sits down) You know, someone to have a nice game of catch with, but—
Norm: Sir, you can have a game of catch with me! I've always thought of you as my fa—
Doofenshmirtz: Norm, you're in my light!
(Norm's mouth turns around, looking sad)
Norm: —ther. 
(In the Flynn-Fletcher backyard)
Isabella: Hey Phineas! Whatcha doin'?
(Buford and Baljeet walk in)
Phineas: (Runs on-screen, wiping his hands) Well, you know one of those little spring suction cup (Puts the cloth in his pocket) things that you push down and you never know when it's gonna pop up in the air?
Isabella: Yeah, what are those things called, anyway?
Phineas: I don't know. But Ferb and I built a big one!
(Camera pans to Ferb, with the complete invention. A fanfare plays)
Buford: Hey look! It's one of those things!
Baljeet: Yes! A big one!
(Instrumental of Phineas and Ferb Theme plays)
Phineas: Everybody in!
(The gang boards the invention. Camera pans to Candace, watching. The spring suction cup pushes down itself)
Isabella: So when's it gonna pop?
Phineas: That's the fun part. You'll never know when it's gonna take off! Hey, where's—
(The spring suction cup takes off) 
(In Perry's lair...)
Major Monogram: I don't know what happened, Carl, but our cafeteria officially stinks.
Carl: Sir, I don't think you're being fair.
Major Monogram: Oh Mexican food station is gone, Carl... VANISH!
Carl: They still have the chili...
Major Monogram: Oh, right! Because chili is a perfect substitute for a nice touchy-taco. It's practically the same thing! (at Perry) Agent P, you're... here! Uhmm... Our inter-web monitor tells us that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been video conference thing with the other members of the evil organization; L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. It's obviously they're planning something big, but right now we have our hands full with this all cafeteria day debacle... so! Get out there and put a stop to it! Good luck, Agent P (Agent P salutes) .... Carl! We're going off the lot for lunch.
Carl: Is that allowed sir?
Major Monogram: Noo... (sigh) 
(Scene shifts to the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Isabella: That was great Phineas!
Baljeet: Yes! Let us do that again!
Phineas: Ferb, let's reset it. 
(In Candace's room...)
Candace: There they go again... their machine mocking me... (imitating Phineas) "Oh, hi, I'm Phineas! Ferb and I are gonna do something totally bust-worthy!" (in her own voice) "Yeah, like what? A submarine that'll go into my esophagus?"
Stacy: Candace, what are you doing?
Candace: Nothing. Did you bring the hypnotism stuff?
Stacy: If you mean the pocket watch, then yes. Why do you want to do this, Candace?
Candace: I have to meet Jeremy in the park today, but I can't go unless I get this busting out of my head!
Stacy: But hypnotism? It's just so 1843 of you.
Candace: 1843?
Stacy: You know, 1843 when James Braid published the "Rationale of Somnambulism" in which he invented the term "hypnotism", named after the Greek god, Hypnos.
Candace: (In a stunned tone) How do you even know that?
Stacy: It's written on your poster. Apparently he also invented the comb-over. Freaky.
Candace: (Still stunned) Why would I have bought that poster? 
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! ♪ 
Doofenshmirtz: (to Perry) Oh this is terrible, look at her, look what I've done. (Gestures at Vanessa sitting on a chair at the balcony) She's been giving me the cold shoulder ever since she overheard something out of context. This is like one of those sitcoms where somebody says something that's misconstrued and the snoopy next door neighbor gets the wrong package delivered after his in-laws come to visit, somebody has two dates on the same night and they have to paint a white line down the middle of the room, but this isn't a sitcom, Perry the Platypus. This is real life. (pauses, as he and Perry glanced at the fourth wall) And... I'm... And I'm the father, and I have to treat her with the respect that she deserves in a caring fatherly fashion. (pause) I'll blast her with one of my inators! Wait here (goes to drag the inator) You like it, Perry the Platypus? I built it for the 170th anniversary of the Alamo, but I forgot to use it! It makes people forget about what they're thinking right at that moment, call it the Forget-About-It-inator! Heheh, I love that name. (starts trying out different tones) Forget about it. Forget about it. Forget about it! Haha, forget about it! (to Perry's face) Forget about it! (turns to Norm) How 'bout a handshake, (swings his hand) forget about it!
Norm: (as he leaves) If only I were a real boy. 
(Back in Candace's room. Stacy is shaking the pocket watch and Candace is cross-eyed)
Stacy: (in a slow voice) You are nooooow entering a deeeeep sleeeeep...
Candace: (monotone) Deeeep sleeeep...
Stacy: What? Sweet! It's working. Candace, when you hear the trigger word, um, (cut to poster that says "Holy Guacamole") "holy guacamole", you will no longer have the desire to bust Phineas and Ferb.
Candace: No more busting my brothers...
Stacy: And when you hear (cut to poster that says "Leapin' Lizards") "leaping lizards", it'll make you return to normal.
Candace: Return to normal...
Stacy: Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awaken with no recollection of being hypnotized. Do you understand, Candace?
Candace: No...
Stacy: No? What's not to understand?
Candace: A brief recap might be helpful...
Stacy: Candace, "holy guacamole" - no busting, "leaping lizards" - back to normal. (Snaps fingers and Candace comes out of hypnotic trance.)
Candace: I don't know, Stacy. I don't think it worked. I still want Phineas and Ferb to go down, down, do-
Stacy: (Interrupting Candace) Holy guacamole.
Candace: What was I talking about?
Stacy: I think you're ready for you're date with Jeremy.
Candace: Ooh! Who's Jeremy?
Stacy: Uh-oh. I think something went wrong.
Candace: I'm just kidding.
Stacy and Candace: Ahh!

(Cut to Candace and Jeremy at the park)
Jeremy: You know what I'd like to do, Candace? I'd like to rent one of those little boats.
Candace: Sure. Good idea.
Jeremy: Great. Let's go before you—
Candace: Before I rush off to bust Phineas and Ferb?
Jeremy: Well...
Candace: Jeremy, I no longer have the desire to bust my brothers. We can take our time. (A lizard hops by. Candace notices it.) Whoa, look at that.
Jeremy: (Laughs) What do you know? Some sort of reptile hopping around. Hi little hopping reptile. Hi little jumping chameleon. Hi little springing salamander.
(Balthazar walks by and notices the lizard.)
Balthazar: Leaping lizards!
(Candace suddenly gets up and leaves.)
Jeremy: Oh yeah. Yeah, funny I didn't think of that one. (Notices that Candace is running away.) Candace? Candace?
Candace: (Running) Sorry, Jeremy! I've got to bust my brothers!
Jeremy: Ah, that's my girl. Looks like it's just you and me, little galavanting gecko. 
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, Vanessa. I just need to take a picture of you because ... I love you and I don't need a son.
Vanessa: (Removing headphones) Did you say something, dad?
Doofenshmirtz: What? You're wearing headphones? So you haven't heard a thing I've said all day?
Vanessa: Why do you think I wear the headphones?
Doofenshmirtz: So you're not mad at me for saying I'd rather have a son than a daughter like you.
Vanessa: What?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, nothing, nothing. Just put these back on. (Puts headphones back in her ears.) There you go.
Vanessa: Whatever.
Doofenshmirtz: (Walking back to Perry and his Inator) What about that? She didn't hear me. I'm still a great dad. And the sitcom cliche has been resolved. I guess I didn't need this inator after all. Say, here's a thought. How about if I blast you instead?
(Norm walks up.)
Norm: Sir, I just want you to know that I've always thought of you as my father.
Doofenshmirtz: Look, Norm. This is going to have to wait. I have to blast Perry the Platypus and I'll be right with you.
(As Doofenshmirtz was talking to Norm, Perry turned the inator around so it was pointing at Doofenshmirtz. Doofenshmirtz looks into the inator and turns it on.)
Doofenshmirtz: There, (To Norm.) Now, who are you?
Norm: I am ... your ... son! (Pause) Yeah!
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, really? (Turns to Perry) And what's that?
Norm: Don't worry, Dad, I'll get rid of it.
(Perry parachutes off the balcony.)
Doofenshmirtz: Funny, I don't seem to remember much.
Norm: You like playing ball with me, your son.
Doofenshmirtz: Really? I like that?
Norm: Yes.
Doofenshmirtz: What else do I like?
Norm: Crunchy eggs for breakfast.
Doofenshmirtz: I do? Man, what kind of weirdo am I? 
(In the backyard, Phineas, Ferb, and their friends are still in their invention.)
Candace: (Running in through gate.) Phineas and Ferb!
Phineas: Hey, Candace!
Candace: I'm telling mom right now. (Running into the house.) Mom! Mom! (Crashing noises from inside.) Mom, you have to come out to the backyard.
Linda: Okay, give me a second.
(Candace runs back out to backyard, laughing.)
Phineas: Candace, do you want to go for a ride?
Candace: No, I'm good.
Linda: Alright, Candace. What was it that you wanted to show me— (Notices invention.) Crimeny! What is that?
Phineas: Hi, Mom!
Candace: You see it! You see it! (The invention takes off) Phineas and Ferb are busted for sure.
Linda: Where's it going?
Candace: Oh, it'll come back down in just a little bit. Just in time for me to get my bust on. 
(Back to Doofenschmirtz and Norm)
Doofenshmirtz: So what's this thing do? Ooh look, buttons! (Pushes buttons) Pushy, pushy! (Green ray comes out of inator) 
Candace: —it comes down, that's great. We can bust Phineas and Ferb and be done in time for dinner.
(Memory erasing ray from Doofenshmirtz's inator hits Linda.)
Linda: So what did you want to show me, Candace?
(Invention lands.)
Candace: Uhm, that.
Linda: Good heavens! What is that?
Candace: Like I said, Phineas and Ferb built it and it's— (Invention takes off again)
Linda: Where's it going?
Candace: It'll be back. And then it's busting time for sure, right Mom?
(Another ray from the inator hits Linda.)
Linda: Alright, Candace. So what was it you wanted to show me? 
Doofenshmirtz: This is fun. Pushy, pushy, push the buttons. I'm pushing the buttons.
Norm: Sir. Sir. 
(Another ray hits Linda.)
Linda: Alright, Candace. So what was it you wanted to show me? (Invention lands.) Holy guacamole! What is that?
Candace: Wait! Why did I leave Jeremy in the park? (Runs off.)
(Another ray hits Linda.)
Linda: (Noticing Perry.) Oh, there you are, Perry. (Perry chatters.) 
Norm: Sir! It's overheating and it could— (Inator explodes.)—explode.
Doofenshmirtz: Hey! Wait a minute. You're not my son. You're that walking junk pile, Norm.
Norm: But dad!
Doofenshmirtz: And I am not you're father. I'm fairly sure about that.
Norm: Bu-bu-bu-bu-but!
Vanessa: Here, Norm. (Gives him headphones.) Wear these. It helps.
Norm: Thanks, sis!
Vanessa: (Sarcastic) No problem, bro.
(Cut to Norm in closet listening to music. Doofenshmirtz opens the door and sticks his head in.)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, buddy. Are you—are you busy?
Norm: No. Not really.
Doofenshmirtz: You know, Norm, it occurs to me that though I've never had a son, there is someone I can always count on to be there. Someone I've begun to think of as family.
Norm: Yes?
Doofenshmirtz: And that someone is Perry the Platypus. See you around, junkpile.
(Doofenshmirtz slams the closet door leaving Norm in the dark. Still wearing the headphones Vanessa gave him, Norm's frown flips around to a smile.)
Norm: Apology accepted, Dad. 
(Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Linda: Candace, honey, I'm going out to a birthday party.
Candace: For who?
Linda: You know Vivian's aunt's sister's landlord's son?
Candace: Evan?
Linda: His son.
Candace: Dexter?
Linda: Yeah. It's his birthday.
Candace: Why do they even have parties for two-year-olds? It's not like they're going to remember anything.
Linda: Baby parties aren't for the babies, Candace. They're for the moms.
Candace: The moms?
Linda: So they can feel rewarded for all the hard work they do.
Candace: (scoffs) Toddlers are easy. They eat, they poop, they sleep. End of story.
Linda: You're a laugh riot, Candace. (starts to leave) Think you can handle watching Phineas and Ferb today?
Candace: Piece of cake.
Linda: Have fun.
Candace: Hmm. Time to be in charge. 
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb in the backyard)
Phineas: So what you're saying is that we should never cut the red wire first.
Candace: Okay, you two, I'm in charge and I'm gonna lay down some rules!
Phineas: Okay, shoot.
Candace: No leaving the yard, no amusement park rides, no robots, no rocket ships, (in background) no time chairs, no remote-controlled llamas, (onscreen) no first edition issuing of commemorative coins, no asking where Perry is, no astrological planetary alignments...
Phineas: (While Candace is talking) Ferb, are you getting all of this? (Ferb holds up a miniature tape recorder) Cool.
(Cut to Perry, who lifts up a board and uses it as a diving board to jump into a pool. In his lair, he jumps onto his chair and notices Doofenshmirtz on the monitor.)
Doofenshmirtz: Surprise! It's me! I've taken over the OWCA!
(Camera pans to Perry then back at the monitor where Major Monogram moves Doofenshmirtz off screen with a finger.)
Major Monogram: Oh, no, he hasn't, Agent P.
Doofenshmirtz: Aw, spoilsport.
Major Monogram: Doofenshmirtz claims to have given up evil. He even signed this "I Give Up Evil" affidavit to apply for work at the agency. And normally, we could have rejected him because he's not an animal, but it turns out he was adopted by ocelots, making him, in the eyes of law, an ocelot.
(Doofenshmirtz purrs)
Major Monogram: Sorry to do this to you, Agent P, but we're making Doofenshmirtz your responsibility during his probation period. Show him the ropes, and, uh, don't let him out of your sight.
(Camera pans back to Perry, who salutes) 
(In the OWCA HQ, Perry and Doofenshmirtz are walking by some of the cubicles.)
Doofenshmirtz: You're probably wondering why I suddenly decided to quit evil and become a good guy. Well you see, I'd just built an inator. I called it the Babe-inator! No, it's not what you think. It's purpose was to transform my brother, the Mayor, and all of his cronies into a bunch of crying babies. That way I could take City Hall like babies taking candy away from... whatever they take candy... Aw, you know what I mean. Anyway, the Babe-inator was ready to go, so I took aim at my brother's office and pressed the button, but it didn't work! It didn't work for, like, the hundredth time! My evil plan did not work! And I thought to myself, "Maybe I'm just not good at being evil." That's when I had my epiphany. From now on, I'm going to be a good guy! So, here I am!
(They stop walking and Perry shows Doofenshmirtz his cubicle)
Doofenshmirtz: Wow, my own cubicle. (Agent Kitty joins him and Perry) How nice! I'm gonna put a poster, right here, with a kitten that says, "Hang in there." (Doofenshmirtz turns and sees Agent Kitty; chuckles awkwardly) No offense. It's not like I think that's all you guys do, or anything. (Agent Kitty walks off) Oh, great, now he's going to Human Resources. 
(Cut to Norm at Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.)
Norm: Oopsies! Better plug this in!
(He does so, and a ray shoots out of the Babe-inator) 
(Cut to the Flynn-Fletcher backyard)
Candace: And no invisible paint.
(The ray from the Babe-inator hits Phineas and Ferb. Phineas babbles then blows a raspberry. Ferb babbles.)
Candace: Oh, my gosh. I don't know how you turned yourselves into babies, but that is sooo bustable! (Holds up her phone) Smile and say, "Hi, Mom!"
(Candace takes a picture with her phone)
Candace: Now, you two are so... (Gasps) Where did they go? (goes off-screen and Ferb comes on) Come back here! No, put the power drill down!
(Candace comes on holding Phineas and sets him down)
Candace: You stay right...
(Ferb grabs her phone and walks off)
Candace: Ferb! No, get back here with my phone. 
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz in his cubicle)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, would you look at that! Newton the Gnu is Agent Silent G. Whoo! I have to blog this. (Notices agents walking by with cups of coffee) Hmm, must be a coffee break. (Computer screen starts blinking saying "security breach" and he turns it off without looking) 
(Scene switches to Candace in the backyard)
Candace: Find the picture and send.
(Switches to Linda at Dexter's party. Linda's cell phone beeps. She takes it out and sees the picture Candace sent.)
Linda: Oh, they used to be so cute. 
(Cut back to Candace. Candace's cell phone beeps. She takes it out and reads a text.)
Candace: "Thanks for the old baby picture." (Sighs) Ooh, wait! I need something with today's date on it. I could take a picture of them with one of those old-fashioned things. It's like a web page with... printed on paper... A newspaper! Ha-ha! (Runs around trying to get Ferb to hold the paper) Okay, stop and hold the paper. Ferb, sweetie? Okay, just stand here and... No! No, don't run away! Wait! Hold it! No, no, no, no. Get back here. How about if we just sit? Then hold the paper. (Ferb throws it) We don't... We... No, don't throw it. Wait! (Candace gives up on Ferb and goes to Phineas) Okay, just hold this. Stay.
Phineas: Gah! (Throws the paper)
Candace: Phineas, no! No throwing. (Phineas crawls to her phone) We use our... (Phineas licks her phone) Ew! (Phineas throws it and it hits Candace) Ow! (Candace tries again on Ferb) Okay, hold this, Ferb. Now, I'll just... Where's my phone?
Phineas: Gah! (Throws her phone into a bird bath)
(Ferb rips up the paper)
Candace: Okay, fine! Okay, if pictures won't work, I'll just take you to Mom myself! I know we have an old stroller around here somewhere. (Candace finds a stroller and straps in Phineas and Ferb and they fall asleep) That's it, go right to sleep. You'll be busted in just a little bit. 
(Cut to the break room, where Doofenshmirtz and few of the other agents are drinking coffee.)
Doofenshmirtz: So then, the duck says, "got any grapes?"
(The agents, excluding the duck, all laugh. Agent P enters)
Doofenshmirtz: Uh-oh, it looks like, uh, coffee break's over.
(Switches to Major Monogram in his office. Doofenshmirtz and/or Perry knocks.)
Major Monogram: Enter. (Doofenshmirtz and Perry enter) Agent P, we have a situation.
Doofenshmirtz: Is this about that grape joke? Who told on me? Was it the duck?!
Major Monogram: That's not why I called you in. Get a look at this. This is Newton the Gnu. He was assigned to Dr. Diminutive, but it seems some bonehead blew his cover on the blogosphere.
(While Major Monogram is talking, Doofenshmirtz scratches his ear.)
We still haven't found out who it was. In the meantime, we need you to bring him in. Get on it, Agent P, and, uh, take Doofenshmirtz with you.
Doofenshmirtz: A ride-along? Sweet! I can wear my new fedora!
Major Monogram: Get out of here! (Doofenshmirtz and Perry leave and Carl walks by with a mail cart) Carl, get in here! When you're done delivering the mail, I want you to wash and wax my car. You know, a little wax on, wax off? It'll teach you karate!
Carl: No, it won't. 
(Cut to a garage where Agent D fills up Perry's hover car with gas. The dog agent leaves as Doofenshmirtz and Perry walk up.)
Doofenshmirtz: I am loving this! We're all like partners, now! Like Jack and Jill, or Alice and Wonderland! And with a super-cool vehicle!
(Cut to the exterior of the O.W.C.A. headquarters, where Major Monogram watches Doofenshmirtz and Perry fly away through his office window)
Major Monogram: Be careful out there... (looks at Carl) ...washing my car. Don't scratch it.
Doofenshmirtz: Ooh, look at these buttons! What does this one do? (he pushes a button which launches a missile) Whoa! Oh, yeah, this is way cool!
(The missile returns to Earth, causing Carl to run away before it blows up Major Monogram's car)
Major Monogram: DOOFENSHMIRTZ! 
(Cut to Candace pushing Phineas and Ferb's stroller through the park.)
Candace: (chuckles) Wait till Mom sees you guys. (Baby Ferb starts crying) Shh!
(Everybody at the park stares at her)
Candace: I didn't do anything! He's my brother, just a baby. They cry you know. (Now Baby Phineas start crying now he cried with him then puts Ferb back his stroller) I know! Toys! I buy you some toys; that's what makes babies stop crying! (pushes the stroller towards a store that coincidentally sells baby things) Oh, thank you. (the stroller gets stuck in the door) I'll just be a second, okay? Don't go anywhere. Stay!
(The babies continue crying, then a robber comes in on his motorcycle and runs into the store. Phineas and Ferb stop crying and pull tools out of their diapers) 
(Cut to the exterior of Dr. Diminutive's apartment)
Doofenshmirtz: This apartment seems familiar. Hey, do you mind if I kick down the door? (he does so, proceeding to get his foot stuck)
Dr. Diminutive: (opens door) Ugh, Doofenshmirtz?
Doofenshmirtz: Awkward!
Dr. Diminutive: Why are you wearing a fedora?
Doofenshmirtz: I'm a good guy now! I believe you've met my partner?
Dr. Diminutive: (gasps) Perry the Platypus? Stay away from me!
(Perry chases Dr. Diminutive, but he disappears when he leaps on him)
Dr. Diminutive: (laughing) Fools! That was only my hologram!
Doofenshmirtz: Don't worry. I've got your back, partner.
Dr Diminutive: (traps Doofenshmirtz and Perry) I trapped you in a particle bubble from my new Photon 2000 Particle Bubble-erator!
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, brother! 2000 was so 4,000 days ago!
Dr. Diminutive: Perhaps you'd like to join your friend, Newton the Gnu in his decidedly ordinary acrylic prison. Can you believe it? I was having him over for a friendly dinner, when I read your blog telling me that Newton the Gnu is really Agent Silent G!
(Perry glares at Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: I can't help it! I blog what I see! 
(Cut back to the store where Candace dropped the babies off)
Candace: I've got some baby stuff!
(Baby Phineas and Ferb rides away on their modified baby stroller)
Candace: Oh, my gosh! Get back here!
(alarm ringing)
Robber: (coming out of store with bags of money) Suckers! (chuckles) Oh, my bike. (the police pull up) Oh, good, the cops are here! I can report this vandalism to the...
Police: Put your hands up!
Robber: (he does so) Oh, that's right. 
(Cut to a baby emporium, where Candace finds baby Phineas and Ferb)
Candace: Phineas and Ferb, get back here!

Doofenshmirtz: Just for the record, that's not exactly what I meant.
Dr. Diminutive: Yeah, I know. (drops them off of building)
Doofenshmirtz: (as he and Agents P & Silent G fall) What do you guys think? How am I doing so far?
(Perry uses his grappling hook to take the Pumanic Bubbletron)
Dr. Diminutive: Hey, give it back!
(Perry uses the Pumanic Bubbletron to make a bubble and traps Dr. Diminutive)
Dr. Diminutive: Uh-oh. Oh, poop.
(Perry makes another bubble and he, Doofenshmirtz, and Agent Silent G bounce on it, breaking their fall)
Doofenshmirtz: Hang on, boys! I'm gonna bounce us back to headquarters! Yee-haw! 
(Cut to Major Monogram's office)
Carl: Sorry about your car, sir. (presents a hubcap to Major Monogram) This is all I could find. (gasps)
Major Monogram: Oh, this is just not working out!
(The bubble crashes into the headquarters) 
(Cut to Dexter's party)
Candace: Hey, Mom! I've found a couple of babies that you need to see!
Ginger: Babies? Oh, let me help! 
Adyson: We'll take good care of them!
Candace: Uh, what are you guys doing here?
Isabella: We're helping Mom's aunt's sister's landlord son.
Linda: Hi, Candace.
Candace: Mom, I need to show you something. 
(Cut to Major Monogram's temporary cubicle)
Major Monogram: It's humiliating! I'm stuck in this crummy, little cubicle while my office gets repaired! Anyway, Agent P, due to your quick action and decisive action, you were able to rescue Agent Silent G. Doofenshmirtz, you're fired.
Doofenshmirtz: Is it because I blew up your car?
Major Monogram: No, it's because I have a list of complaints from Human Resources.
Doofenshmirtz: So, it was the duck! (Looks at the duck. The dog and crocodile do the same)
(The duck agent backs away in his chair)
Major Monogram: Let's face it. You've done more damage inside the Agency than you ever did outside.
Doofenshmirtz: So, what you're saying is that I'm good at being evil after all! (calls Norm) Norm, we're back in business! Dust off the inators! (hangs up) Later, chumps!
(Switches to D.E.I.)
Norm: I'll start with this one!
(Another ray shoots out of the Babe-inator) 
(Cut to Dexter's party)
Candace: Mom, these aren't babies that look like Phineas and Ferb. This is Phineas and Ferb.
(The Babe-inator's ray hits Isabella, Linda and Katie, which turns them into babies. The same is done with the remaining Fireside Girls, excluding Holly and Adyson. All of the babies, excluding Phineas and Ferb, then start crying.)
Candace: (talking loudly) Okay, I get it. Lesson learned. Toddlers aren't easy! The irony is not lost in me! Little help here? Ugh, this had better wear off before the next episode. 
(Scene opens up showing Phineas and Ferb sitting under a tree.)
Linda: Hey boys, want some fat-free whole-grain granola bars? They're still warm from the oven.
Phineas: Whole-grain and fat-free? (He and Ferb take a granola bar.) You know us so well.
Linda: (Walks off) Yes, yes I do.
(Phineas and Ferb eat their granola bars.)
Phineas: You know, Mom's always doing nice things for us. I think it's time we did something nice for Mom! Let's see... We could—No...
(Quiz show music plays.)
Phineas: Or—Uh uh.
(Ferb gasps)
Phineas: Huh...
(He and Ferb repeatedly gasp. They stop and the quiz show music plays again slowly.)
Isabella: Hey, Phineas! Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: We're trying to think of a nice thing we can do for Mom. Any ideas?
Isabella: You can clean up the whole house for her!
Baljeet: Or, you can get a classic wooden slide rule from Analog Emporium.
Buford: How do I know what adults like? What am I, a computer?
Phineas: That's it! I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna make a super computer!
Buford: What? Your Mom wants a super computer? What is she? Some kind of nerd?
Phineas: No, we're gonna ask the computer what to do for Mom.
Baljeet: Slide rule! I gave it to you on a silver platter! 
(Scene shifts to the interior of the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Linda: Okay, I'm going out. (Pulls out a coupon) I've got a coupon for a free hair styling from this new salon. I'm gonna freshen up my look. Granola bars are in the kitchen! (walks away)
Candace: Ugh. Maybe I'll feed mine to Perry. Hey, where is Perry? 
(Outside, Perry puts on his fedora, pulls on a flower, and enters an open hole. Inside the lair, the screen turns on.)
Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. The entire Tri-State Area's becoming riddled with holes. Also, numerous light beams have been shot from Doofenshmirtz's building. Either he's having some sort of a rave, or he's the one behind all those holes. Investigate at once! (Salutes) Good luck, Agent P!
(Perry salutes back and takes off on his jet-pack)

Isabella: He's cute! 
(At Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc., a ray fires, and an item comes back with the ray. This continues until Perry arrives.)
Doofenshmirtz: (Repeatedly firing his ray) That's not it... That's not it...
(Perry enters through a panel on the wall and hides)
Doofenshmirtz: That's not it... (Picks up an item) That is not it.
(Perry straightens his fedora, and then runs)
Doofenshmirtz: That's not it.
(Perry is covered with cement and is shaped into a brick. The cement quickly dries as Perry tries to escape)
Doofenshmirtz: (Laughs) Welcome, Perry the Platypus. How do you like your trap? That's super quick drying cement. See? (Knocks on the cement) Solid as a, uh... I dunno, some rock-like substance. Cement, maybe! Now, with you safely trapped, I introduce you to the Metal-Unearth-inator! (The Metal-Unearth-inator fires, and a can comes back) 
(Cut to the Flynn-Fletcher backyard)
Phineas: All right, gang, It's ready to go. We just need to perform an initial scan of the Tri-State Area so it has enough data to work with.
(The supercomputer's antenna rises, and starts its initial scan)
Supercomputer: Scanning the Tri-State-Area. 
(In the scrap yard)
Boy: Between that and the random laser drills, this is like the second best mid-day scrapyard rave ever! 
(Inside a hospital)
Doctor: (Preparing to activate a CT scanner) Hold still and... (The red scan light flashes, showing her skeleton. She pulls out her cell phone) Hello, Hospital Workers Union. 
(The scan light flashes at Norm)
Norm: Get out of my mind! 
(Back at the backyard)
Supercomputer: Gathering data from all objects and habitants. Computing all logical outcome of all events. (Finishes scanning, bell dings) Done.
Phineas: Okay, computer. Are you ready to answer any question?
Supercomputer: Yes, my data is complete. My logic, infallible.
(Phineas and Ferb laugh)
Phineas: What's 2 + 2?
Supercomputer: 4. Perhaps you should just count on your fingers.
Phineas: Sorry. What's the square root of 72,361?
Supercomputer: 269. Try something more unusual.
Isabella: What are the names the girls in my Fireside Girls troop?
Supercomputer: Gretchen, Adyson, Holly, Katie, Milly, and Ginger.
Isabella: Wow, he's good!
Baljeet: On a multi-valve engine with variable timing, how can I isolate an exhaust valve leak at the stem seal without removing the can shaft?
Supercomputer: Coat the engine with tomato paste and the leak will reveal itself.
(Baljeet elbows Buford)
Buford: He's right! Uh, what size pants do I wear?
Supercomputer: Boys, husky, extra large.
(Buford elbows Baljeet)
Baljeet: He's right!
Buford: Impressive! (Thumbs up)
Phineas: Well, you seem to be working perfectly so, computer, what is the nicest thing we can do for Mom today?
Supercomputer: Computing... (Ding) Done. Get a gallon of industrial marking dye and a leaf blower. Tie balloons onto them. Then, go to the top of Danville Hill, and at 2:37 p.m., release them into the wind.
Phineas: Really?
Supercomputer: Nothing would make your mother happier today.
(Baljeet has a glum face)
Baljeet: You turned that slide rule for this?
Phineas: I don't know, Baljeet. From what we seen so far, I think a little blind faith is called for.
Baljeet: You know nothing about women.
Buford: Dude, it's over.
(Candace walks out of the sliding door)
Candace: Okay, there must be something bustable going on around here. (Notices the super computer; she drops her phone.) What...is..that?
Supercomputer: I am a super computer. I can answer any question that you can possibly ask.
Candace: Did my brothers make you?
Supercomputer: Yes. Yes, they did.
Candace: Okay. So, let me think of a question... Hmm... How many states in the United States?
Supercomputer: 50.
Candace: What goes on top of pancakes?
Supercomputer: Butter and syrup.
Candace: How do you pronounce the "J" in "Jalapeño"?
Supercomputer: It makes the "H" sound.
Candace: (Hisses) I knew that. How many fingers behind my back?
Supercomputer: Two.
Candace: Okay, that's just freaky. And...bustable! All I gotta do is... (Pause) But it never works! No matter what I try, whatever the boys do just disappears before Mom looks! If only there was some way to guarantee Mom would see what the boys done? (Looks at the supercomputer) Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee... 
(In an alleyway, a dog puts down a bone. A ray fires and the dog runs off. The item caught by the ray drops on Doofenshmirtz's balcony.)
Doofenshmirtz: What? Another one? Why are there so many helmets buried in the Tri-State Area? (Tosses it off) Ah, onto the pile you go.
(The helmet lands on a pile of old, dirty stuff. The camera zooms out, showing Perry trapped)
Doofenshmirtz: So, Perry the Platypus, hope you didn't come here because of the holes, because the Metal-Unearth-inator is not even my final plan. May I present to you my real plan? The All-Purpose-inator! You heard of a man's man? Well, this is an inator's inator. (His hand is seen on the control panel) It does everything! (Takes his hand off the control panel) Of course, once I activate it, it will make all my inators obsolete, but, uh... I guess that's progress. Unfortunately, I ran into a little snag...
(Flashback. Doofenshmirtz is seen finishing the All-Purpose-inator)
Doofenshmirtz: After putting all the final touches on my All-Purpose-inator, I took a step back to admire my handiwork. Victory was finally within my grasp.
(Flashback Doofenshmirtz cackles)
Doofenshmirtz: All I needed to do is turn the thing on. (Flashback Doofenshmirtz pulls out a key) Then fate made a cruel joke. (Flashback Doofenshmirtz slips on green paint. The key falls off the balcony) The ignition key fell of my balcony!
Flashback Doofenshmirtz: Nooooooo!!!!! (With binoculars, he spots a gopher take the key and run into its hole)
Doofenshmirtz: I could tell he was laughing. You know, that way gophers do. And there's no way I was going to go all the way down there to get the key. I've got a schedule to keep.
(End flashback)
Doofenshmirtz: So, I decided to build the Metal-Unearth-inator to track down and dig up the key so I can fire up my All-Purpose-inator...
(At this point, the camera shows that Perry is playing a game of solitaire on the cement block.)
...so I can take over the Tri-State Area. Somehow. You know, you can put the red king on... (groaning) Hey; you're not even listening. 
(Back at the backyard, Candace is talking to the supercomputer.)
Candace: But then, when I bring Mom into the backyard, it's gone and Mom never sees it. So here's my question, Mr. Supercomputer, how can I get my Mom to see what my brothers have done?
Supercomputer: Elementary. You must build a device that makes your Mom see what your brothers have done.
Candace: What kind of device?
Supercomputer: Follow my instructions to the letter and when you have finished, I am 100% certain that your Mom will see what your brothers have done.
Candace: Okay. Where do I start? (pulls out a notepad and a pencil)
Supercomputer: (while Candace is writing) You are going to need a toaster, a number two screwdriver, some electrical tape... 
(At Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc., the ray from the Metal-Unearth-inator keeps on retrieving helmets.)
Doofenshmirtz: Helmet, helmet, another helmet. What happened here?
(A chisel has fallen onto the balcony)
A chisel? (picks it up) Well, it's no key but at least we're getting closer in size. (tosses it over his shoulder)
(The chisel bounces off the pile of metal items and hits the cement block with a clang. A second later, the Metal-Unearth-inator retrieves...)
A hammer? Why would someone bury a hammer? Well, onto the pile you go. (tosses the hammer)
(The hammer lands directly onto the chisel, which enables Perry to escape from the cement block trap. He then stops to take a look at the pile.)
Doofenshmirtz: I'm closing in on the key. I can feel it. (gasps) Perry the Platypus, how did you get out?
(Camera pans to Perry, who's wearing a Roman solder's helmet and also holding a flail, which he twirls around for a few seconds.)
Doofenshmirtz: (gasps again) Well, two can play at that game.
(He reaches into the pile and then is seen with a radio on his head and holding a ladle and a fan in his hands.)
Doofenshmirtz: (chuckles; awkward silence) Uh, wait a second. Hold on. (rummages in the pile) Not this, not this. There was a whole bunch of 'em just a couple of minutes ago. A-ha! Jackpot!
(He's now seen wearing a viking helmet with a sword and shield in his hands.)
Doofenshmirtz: Now, Perry the Platypus, meet your doom. (screams)
(A flail and sword fight then starts between Doofenshmirtz and Perry.) 
(Phineas, Ferb, and their friends--with the exception of Baljeet as Buford's carrying him--are now hiking up Danville Hill. A bunch of balloons have been tied to a container of industrial orange marker dye and a leaf blower.)
Phineas: Keep up, Buford, it's almost 2:37.
Buford: Hey, I don't have balloons to lighten my load.
Baljeet: I would have walked.
All: Three, two, one... (Phineas and Ferb releases the items into the air.) Liftoff!
Phineas: There they go. Industrial orange marker dye and a leaf blower. Guaranteed happiness for Mom. Somehow. Let's follow and see what happens.
(The kids then run down the hill to do just that.)
Phineas: This way, everybody.
(They jump over a fence, which Baljeet trips over.)
Baljeet: Sure, now you put me down. 
(In the backyard, Candace has finished some kind of contraption.)
Candace: There, finished. Did I put it together right?
Supercomputer: You built it perfectly, Candace. Your Mom will definitely see what the boys have done. And you finished it just in time, because in two seconds your Mom is going to pull up.
(car honks)
Candace: Wow! You're right about everything! (runs off) I can't lose! (to Linda) Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mo...
(Candace trails off as she opens the driver's side door,... revealing Linda's bad hair-do.) Uh....
Linda: I'm having a bad day.
Candace: Uh, never mind. Come on, come on, come on! (pushes Linda towards the backyard) 
(At Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc., the flail and sword fight continues. Doofenshmirtz finally gets the upper hand when he disarms Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: So, no so tough without your mace. (Perry glares at him) Now, I have the upper hand. (Perry takes off the helmet) Prepare to meet your doom... (He holds up the shield after Perry throws it at him.) You throw your helmet at me? That's so lame, Perry the... (Perry starts throwing helmets at him.) Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
(Doofenshmirtz "accidentally" activates the Metal-Unearth-inator and the ray reaches the backyard of the Flynn-Fletcher home.) 
(In the backyard)
Supercomputer: Precisely on schedule.
(The ray picks it... and a gopher... up from the ground.)
Supercomputer: Hello gopher! (the wiring detaches from it)
(The gopher, holding a key, looks down with surprise.)
Candace: (pushes Linda into the backyard with eyes closed) It's over here! It's over here! See?
(Just as Candace opens her eyes, the balloons carrying the items floats into the backyard.)
Phineas: Hi, Candace!
Linda: You know, Candace (turns around) most days, this is just a little disturbing. But today, with the free coupon (camera pans up) and this whole awful thing with my hair...
(The camera shows the supercomputer still in the ray's grasp.)
Supercomputer: And the gopher lets go now.
(The gopher looses its grip on the key, and bumps off the container, which causes the orange marketing dye to pour out. Luckily, the gopher catches hold of the pull string on the leafblower. The little critter then goes for a wild ride after it starts.)
Linda: (with eyes closed) If only I had...
(The orange dye falls onto her hair then the leafblower arrives to blow dry it.)
Linda: (groans)
(The toaster gives a ding! and a hand mirror pops out of it.)
Linda: (opens her eyes; looks in the hand mirror) Huh?
(Sure enough, Linda's hair is back to normal, complete with her headband.)
Linda: My hair looks so...cute! I guess it just needed some time to settle. (walks away)
Candace: But, but, but, buuuuuu...
Linda: It's so great when something nice happens to you, especially when you weren't expecting it. (exits)
Candace: What just happened?
Phineas: We did something nice for Mom. We fixed her bad hairdo. Apparently.
Candace: You did that?
Phineas: Yup.
Candace: You... did that?
Phineas: That's right. With a little supercomputer help.
Candace: So, when Mom looked in the mirror on that thing I built, she saw what you had done?
Phineas: That's right.
Ferb: And by the way, nice use of the accordion arm.
Candace: Oh! I hate computers! (exits)
Phineas: Hey, where'd the computer go? 
(Scene shifts to Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.)
(Metal-Earth-inator beeping)
Doofenshmirtz: Ooh! The key detection alarm! I forgot I installed that. (tosses the sword and shield) Here it comes,...
(The shield lands on the floor and the sword lands straight up in it)
...here it comes, here it comes. (pause) Wait!
Supercomputer: I knew this was going to happen.
Doofemshmirtz: Uh-oh.
(The Metal-Earth-inator retrieves the supercomputer at the same time Perry's leaving the building on his jet-pack. A second later, there's an explosion.)
Well, at least I found the key to the...
(A second explosion occurs, blowing off the retractable roof.)
Nice! Curse you, Perry the...
(The roof lands lopsidedly onto the building.)
(groans) Why does everything explode so easily?
(And cue the third explosion.)
Yeah, I knew that was gonna happen. 
(Scene opens up showing Stacy running to the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Stacy: I'm coming as fast as I can, Candace! I'm at your house. Now, what kind of emergency are we dealing with? A parent emergency? A Phineas and Ferb emergency? Oh my--
Candace: (has an unusual hairstyle) Ahhhh-ha-ha! AHHHH!
Stacy: A hair emergency: the worst kind! This is awful! How did--? Wait, what are these 4 long streads, and look at this shaved areal! What's that all about? Is this a rolled-up sock? Candace, who did this to you?
Candace: Stacy, I did it to myself.
Stacy: Why?
Candace: Jeremy's mom is hosting a benefit for endangered animals this afternoon, and I wanted a new look!
Stacy: So you want your hair to look like an endangered species?
Candace: No, there are all these How-To videos online. They make it look so easy.
Lady in Video: Just brush it up, toss your head back, and viola! It's simplicious.
Candace: It's not simplicious! It's hard-plicious!
Stacy: Candace, take it easy.
Candace: Look at me! (Lies on laptop keyboard) A tragic victim of Internet hair stylists!
Stacy: Sorry, I don't think there's anything I can do, but there are a couple of guys who could...
Candace: No, no way!
Stacy: Uh, are these chopsticks?
Candace: Ugh, all right. PHINEAS AND FERRRB?!
(Phineas and Ferb comes into Candace's room drinking water, then they spit out the water because they noticed Candace's hair)
Phineas: What do you think? We been working on our spit takes all morning.
Candace: Yeah, yeah, you're hilarious. Listen, I need you two to get me out of this situation.
Phineas: Why? Your hair is simplicious!
Ferb: Have you tried tossing your head back?
Candace: Look, I don't have time to explain. Just get me back to the way I was.
Phineas: Okay; yeah, but I think you're making a mistake.
Stacy: Hey, where's Perry? (Candace glares at her) What, I'm like the only person who's never said it. 
(Agent P's in the backyard climbing up a tree, then sits on a egg a goes down a fast tube and enters his lair)
Major Monogram: Good afternoon, Agent P. For the past few days, our motion sensors have detected Dr. Doofenshmirtz rummaging around in his basement. So, last night we had Carl stake down there behind his water heater.
Carl: It was horrible down there!
Major Monogram: Carl!
Carl: I saw a rat give birth... to a snail!
Major Monogram: Just tell him about Doofenshmirtz.
Carl: Doofenshmirtz kept coming down and grabbing pieces of his old Inators from cardboard boxes. Oh no, brown recluse spider's favor dwelling in cardboard boxes! (Major Monogram touches him in the ear; He shrieks) Get it off! Get it off!
Major Monogram: Get out there and find out what Doof is up to. (At Carl) Seriously Carl? What a baby.
Carl: I think it laid eggs in my ear! 
(Phineas and Ferb have completed the machine to fix Candace's hair and Candace is now sitting in the chair of the machine)
Phineas: So by combining ultra-violet and infrared waves together with follicle stimulation properties, not only does it style your hair, but it stimulates and accelerates new hair growth! So that should take care of that little shaved area. (at Stacy) What's that all about?
Stacy: Don't get me started.
Phineas: (at Candace) All you have to do is sit there for thirty minutes on setting five and you're good to go.
Candace: Yeah, yeah, tick-tock.
Phineas: Start her up Ferb. (at Candace) Remember, thirty minutes on setting five.
Candace: Thanks guys!
(Candace's tangerine orangutan ringtone goes off and Phineas and Ferb leave the room)
Stacy: What was that?
Candace: Oh, I changed my ringtone. That's a tangerine orangutan. Endangered animals! (looks at her phone) Oh, it's Jeremy! (she picks it up) Hi. You're uh, picking me up in ten minutes? Great! (nervous laugh) Bye. (hangs up the phone) Ten minutes! Stacy, crank this thing up. If it takes a half an hour on five it should do the trick in ten seconds on twenty.
Stacy: I don't know Candace, maybe you shouldn't mess with-
Candace: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it'll be fine.
Stacy: (nervously) Ok.
(Stacy turns the dial to twenty and the machine lights up over Candace's head)
Candace: Besides Stacy, they wouldn't put a twenty on it if it weren't meant to be used, right? Stacy: Well...I guess so.
Candace: Oh, my ten seconds are up! (lifts the top part of the machine from her head) Well, how does it look?
Stacy: (gasps) I can't believe it! It's perfect!
Candace: Told you it'd be fine.
(the camera zooms in on Candace's neck, which is now starting to grow hair)
Candace: Ooh, now help me find something cute to wear. 
(The scene changes to Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. and Perry is seen using a lock pick to break into Doofenshmirtz's apartment. He opens the door to find Doofenshmirtz surrounded by a thick fog playing on pipe organs. Doofenshmirtz presses a key on the organ and Perry falls into a hole that somehow brings him upwards to get trapped in one of the organ's pipes.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus I don't like your tone. (plays dramatic chords on the organ) Behold...I give you...The very VERY BAD-INATOR!
(The Bad-inator rises dramatically from the floor as Doofenshmirtz says this. He then gets up from the organ and walks toward the Inator)
Doofenshmirtz: It's made up of only the most evil parts of my old Inators, cobbled together without any rhyme or reason. My plan is to load it on my floating platform, take it high above the Tri-State Area and, you know, turn it on and see what it does. (turns towards Perry) I have no idea but I'm sure it's gonna be bad. Hence, Very Bad-inator. (pretends to shiver) Ooh, I got a chill! 
(The scene changes to the Natural History Museum where Jeremy's parents are hosting the benefit for endangered animals.)
Candace: (walking into the museum) Wow, nice turnout.
Jeremy: Yeah.
Candace: Hey, there's your mom.
Mrs. Johnson: There you two are! Don't you look nice, Candace.
Candace: Oh, thanks Mrs. Johnson.
Mrs. Johnson: Come on, I'll show you where we're sitting. (she begins to lead them to the table) We have a very good turn out this year, many of Danville's top zoologists are here.
(Candace notices hair growing on her hand as she walks and quickly yanks it out)
Scientist #2: (to Scientist #1) I bet I'll have more species named after me than you do, care to make a wager?
Scientist #1: No.
Scientist #2: Why not?
Scientist #1: Because your last name is Pithecus.
Scientist #2: (laughs)
Mrs. Johnson: The money that this banquet raises will go a long way to facilitate solutions for the problems these poor animals face.
(Hair begins to sprout all over Candace's body.)
Candace: (through clenched teeth) Great!
Jeremy: Uh, Candace, I think you've got a little food or something on your lip.
Candace: (covering her mouth with her hand) Will you excuse me for a moment? (runs off to a table with an elderly couple sitting at it) Umm, I just need to see this spoon for a- (uncovers her mouth and sees the mustache growing on her face and screams. She then hides under the table and calls her brother.) Phineas.
Phineas: Oh hi Candace. (at Ferb and Linda at the dinner table) It's Candace. (at Candace) You turned it up to twenty? So what happened?
Candace: (mumbles are heard from the phone)
Phineas: No way! That is so cool.
Candace: (mumbles are heard from the phone again)
Phineas: Ok, I'll see what we can do. (he hangs up the phone) Mom, may Ferb and I be excused? Candace needs help with her hair.
Linda: So you guys are hair stylists now?
Phineas: Apparently.
Linda: So, what would you do with my hair?
Phineas: Nothing, it's perfect the way it is.
Linda: Wow, you are good.
Phineas: Girlfriend, please. 
Doofenshmirtz: (on the flying platform) Be careful Perry the Platypus, you're awfully close to the edge. Oh! Let me help you back. (laughs as Perry is sent from one side of the platform to the other) I'm just messing with ya. 
Jeremy: Candace! Candace? Now where'd she go?
Candace: I gotta find a better place to hide. (Candace moves the table away from the elderly couple)
Old Man: (making magic fingers) Ooohhhh.
Old Lady: Oh stop it.
Old man: You've lost your joie de vivre.
(Candace runs the table by the two scientists to go backstage)
Scientist #1: Wow, this thing keeps getting weirder every year!
Professor Jones: (practicing his speech) It is wonderful to see such a fine turnout- AAAH!
(Candace comes up behind him and tosses the table on him)
Candace: (looking at her hair covered hands) AAH!
Scientist #2: (on stage) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's lecture!
Jeremy: (calling Candace) Where did she go?
Scientist #2: Won't you all please help welcome...
Candace: (as more hair grows all over her body) Oh no!
Scientist #2: Professor Herbert Fonzworth Weatherman Jones!
(the curtains open, revealing Candace now completely covered in hair. Jeremy's ringtone on Candace's phone goes off)
Jeremy: Huh...?
Mrs. Johnson: That's not professor Herbert Fonzworth Weatherman Jones, that's the rare tangerine orangutan! We have to capture it and return it to the wild. (getting up from the table) Stand back everyone, I have an associate's degree in zoology, I got this.
Candace: Oh no! Jeremy's mother! She can't see me like this!
(Candace runs off the stage, knocking over tables in her haste)
Mrs. Johnson: (chasing Candace down hallways) Come back! Don't run away! I mean you no harm!
Candace: (now in a fossil exhibit) AAH! (she climbs up the bones of a T-Rex to reach the window outside and climbs out)
Mrs. Johnson: No, no, no! Don't go up there, don't go up on the roof! (at Jeremy) Jeremy, honey, would you do me a favor and call animal control please?
Jeremy: Sure thing, Mom.
(outside the museum Phineas and Ferb spots Candace)
Phineas: Hey Ferb, look up there! That's Candace on the roof. And I was worried this function would be dull. (he calls Candace)
Candace: (on the phone) Phineas help! Jeremy's mom thinks I'm an orangutan and is trying to return me to the wild!
Phineas: Ok, hang tight. We brought the hair remover.
(the scene shifts to Doofenshmirtz on his flying platform)
Doofenshmirtz: This looks like the perfect spot to fire up the Really Bad-inator. (taps on the control panel of the machine) I can't wait to see what it does. Guess we'll have to wait. Ooh I brought snacks. (walks over to the picnic basket) Let me see what I have here. (rummages through the basket) Baby carrots, some grapes, and a- ooh, peanut butter! Ooh, and some honey! See, Perry the Platypus, most people like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but I really prefer peanut butter and honey.
(Perry struggles in his trap)
(the scene shifts to Phineas and Ferb)
Phineas: Very few people know that Myron's Discus Thrower was made with real ancient disc-throwing action.
(Phineas and Ferb climb onto the statue) Hang on Ferb! (pushes a button on the statue with his foot, sending the arm of the statue spinning) Wwwweeeee! (Phineas and Ferb are thrown onto the roof near Candace) Candace? Ferb and I made a sonic oscillator. This baby'll blow the hair of a peach at ninety yards.
Candace: Great, get this hair off of me.
Mrs. Johnson: (opening the window to the roof) Yoohoo! Hello? Little friend, where did you go?
Phineas: Come on Ferb.
(Phineas and Ferb sneak around the edge of the dome to hide from Jeremy's mom.)
Mrs. Johnson: I see you!
Animal Control Guy: Animal control. You got a monkey that needs tranquilizing?
Mrs. Johnson: That is not a monkey, it's the very rare tangerine orangutan.
Animal Control Guy: (loading the darts into the tranquilizer gun) Yeah yeah, tomato potato. Just leave it to the professionals. (he cocks the tranquilizer gun and fires at Candace)
Candace: AAH!
(She climbs higher on the dome to escape the dart, which misses her and bounces off. The dart then travels to hit the Animal Control Guy.)
Animal Control Guy: (seeing the dart in his backside) Huh. Would you look at that. Well, you probably noticed that I'm ah...not that good at my job so...you can just take this and I'll be right back. (he passes out)
(Doofenshmirtz is still rummaging through the picnic basket while Perry struggles to free himself from his trap)
Doofenshmirtz: Ooh yes. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches. The trick is the honey, and you get to use one of these weird honey-spoony things. (crashes are heard) Perry the Playtpus, did you just say gungalingdung? (Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz in the face, causing honey to pour all over Doofenshmirtz) Aww, great! Now I'm sticky. (he gets up while Perry goes to the controls) Aww, no, and this was my last clean lab coat too. Ugh, it's on now! (Perry takes the controls with a mischievous smirk on his face as he rocks the platform back and forth.) Hey! Hey, hey! What are you doing? Oh, I get. Payback. Very funny, Perry the Platypus. How very mature.
Mrs. Johnson: (reading the instruction manual for the tranquilizer gun) Thank you for purchasing the Hanson 3000 Family Friendly Tranquidart Air-contrast delivery system. There are many like it but this one is yours.
Candace: Phineas, hurry, while she's distracted!
Phineas: Alright, Candace.
(Ferb fires the gun, blowing the hair off of Candace, leaving her with her trademark hairstyle.)
Candace: Hey it worked!
(Candace slides down the pole and the scene shifts back to Doofenshmirtz and Perry)
Doofenshmirtz: As soon as I get this honey off of me, I- (Candace's hair hits Doofenshmirtz, sending him off of the platform and onto the pole where Candace once was.) Is this hair? (Perry is still on the platform and manages to disable the Very Bad-inator. He escapes on his glider.) Oh, no! Now I'll never know what the Bad-inator does! Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
Mrs. Johnson: The red plunger will act as a non-return valve and retain the air within the dart. Fear not, helpless primate! Bright banquets of the Elysian vale will soon melt every care away, or my name isn't Hawk-eye Johnson! (aims; tranquilizer gun cocks; shoots)
Doofenshmirtz: Ow! Shot in the butt with a dart, while covered in honey and hair? Well, what do you know, my horoscope was right. (hugging pole) Oh, my beautiful, beautiful horoscope.
Mrs. Johnson: Oh, no! What have I done? She's going to fall!
Doofenshmirtz: (drowsily) Hold the door, Barbara. I think this is our floor. (falls)
Candace: Thanks, guys! I could just hug you! (proceeds to hug her brothers, but ends up catching a hair and honey-covered Doofenshmirtz instead)
Phineas: Awesome!
Mrs. Johnson: Candace? You caught her! You saved this orangutan!
Animal control guy: I'll take it from here. (grunts) Leave it to the professionals.
Doofenshmirtz: Mama, I'm pretty.
Mrs. Johnson: I knew you were a good catch.
Candace: Thanks Mrs. Johnson.
Jeremy: I didn't know you were helping out my mom. You made quite an impression on her.
Candace: Well, I guess you could say I am having a good bad hair day.

Isabella: Thanks for letting us host the French Fireside Girls at your cabin, Mr. and Mrs. Flynn. This'll be a great place for them to get their North American Tracking patches.
Clyde: What did I do again?
Phineas: The French Fireside Girls, or Les filles en coin de feu, as they're known in their country of origin, are going for their North American Tracking patches. And you're helping us help them.
Betty Jo: I put a sticky note on your shirt.
Clyde: (sees the note) Aww. And you wrote "love". (whispers as they leave) I knew it was there.
Betty Jo: Why do you play senile?
Clyde: I love your notes!

Isabella: Whoa, whoa, stop, stoppez! That's all the French I've got.
Brigitte: D'accord. I am Brigitte, and these are Josette and Collette.
Josette/Collette: Bonjour!
Isabella: (gestures to Phineas and Ferb) And this is --
Brigitte: Phineas et Ferb! (Holds up newspaper) We read your column in Les filles au coin de feu Gazette.
Isabella: (Humbly) I'm syndicated.
Phineas: Naturellement.
Baljeet: (He wheels in a large crate with a tarp over it) Everyone, please stand back! Keep your fingers, and berets away from the bars.
Isabella: Les filles au coin du feu, to earn your American Tracking Patch, you'll have to capture the most dangerous of creatures, the vicious, American, (She pulls away the tarp, revealing Buford in a bear costume) grizzly bear.
Baljeet: He has not been fed.
(Buford roars, buts stops short when he sees Brigitte)
Isabella: My friend has graciously agreed to be the bear for today's hunt.
(Buford pulls the tarp back over the cage)
Baljeet: Excuse me. (He goes around to the back of the cage) What is up?
Buford: (he pulls Baljeet inside) Get in here! I know that girl out there!
Baljeet: You do?
Buford: Yeah, we met, in Paris. (He flashes back) It was a year ago, and I was taking in some of the local color, when I saw her, Brigitte. She was a beautiful French girl, and I was an ugly American. Which of course holds a certain mystique. With her I completely forgot myself. I read poetry, I wept at beauty, I clipped my toenails. For Brigitte, I even learned to speak the language of love, French talk.
Baljeet: Oh, that is why you are fluent in French.
Buford: It was easy actually. A lot of the root words are the same in Latin. But I can't let anyone know I have a heart, it'll ruin my tough-guy image. And believe me, the irony is not lost on me in this suit. Aw man, don't you see, if I get all gushy now, I'll be totally exposed! I can't stand it! (He pushes Baljeet aside, and flees the cage)
Isabella: There he goes. Let the tracking begin. (The girls run after him)
Baljeet: Wait, you speak Latin!?
Phineas: Go get 'em girls!
Clyde: You'll never catch me running around in a fuzzy bear suit, (He passes for a moment) in this heat.
Phineas: It is a tad sweltering. A little fun with water might be in order.
Clyde: Way ahead of ya' kiddo. (He shows them a sprinkler)
Phineas: You're on the right track Grandpa, mind if we kick it up a notch?
Clyde: I was hoping you might.
Phineas: Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry? 
(Perry puts on his hat, and slides into a log, where there is a monitor at the back)
Major Monogram: Good morning Agent P. I'd tell you what Doofenshmirtz is up to but the screen isn't big enough for the little box thingy over my shoulder, but I'm sure you'll figure it out when you get there. Good luck Agent P.

♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! ♪
(Perry arrives at Doofenshmirtz's door and kicks it down, only to find another door blocking him, he kicks this one down as well, and continues to kick in eight more)
Doofenshmirtz: Aw, Perry the Platypus, are you felling tired?
(The door Perry was standing on wraps itself in a sheet, trapping Perry)
Doofenshmirtz: Take a rest! I figured you'd be exhausted after breaking all those doors. I-I even put a mint on your pillow, and everything, though, I guess it's probably just stuck to the back of your head now. Sorry about that. So, let's talk about pretzels. You see Perry the Platypus, when I was younger, (Doofenshmirtz flashes back) I did a summer internship at Master Drakkenblad's Pretzel Palace, He was the biggest pretzel wizard in Drusselstein. His disproportionately delicate hands, could turn any dough into a masterpiece. But even after months, my pretzel still lacked, polish. No matter how hard I tried, my work was never good enough. I don't know why he was such a stickler, I mean it's a knot. What difference does it make as long as you can't untie it? It's a knot! Anyway, I was declared unworthy. (Doofenshmirtz's Flash back ends) So now I despise pretzels. And any pretzel related entertainment. And now Danville is having its own Pretzel Festival! Can you even imagine how angry that makes me? Can you imagine? No? Angry enough to create the De-Twist-inator! We'll see how festive they feel after I turn all those stupid pretzels into boring straight tubes of baked dough, like-like breadsticks, which I also have a problem with, but I'm dealing with one neurosis at a time. And then, when I've straightened all their precious pretzels, I will waltz in, and take over the Tri-State Area. Yeah, I know it doesn't quite follow. I mean I even made a venn diagram. (He hold up a venn diagram, with to circles, not intersecting at all) See, the-the pretzels are here in this circle, and we're talking about taking over the Tri-State Area here, and... Yeah, no intersection, nothing. Hmm. But I'm gonna work it out you'll see. 
(Phineas, Ferb, and Baljeet work on their super sprinkler underwater to the tune of the Quirky Worky Song) 
Brigitte: You see here, these tracks indicated, that he went in that direction.
Isabella: Great! Come on, let's check it out!
Brigitte: But, the weight was on the balls of his feet instead of the heels, he retraced his steps to here. Voilà! the footprints continue here. This way, the hunt is on!

Brigitte: Fireside Girls, goggle on. (The Fireside Girls don goggles) He has gone completely animal. He smells us. Pursue! 
Doofenshmirtz: And when the chickens hatch, that's when the marshmallows kick in. Oh, oh boy, this one really taxed my brain. I am telling you, I am pooped. Anyway, forget the details, the circles are touching so the plan can't miss. Now, I've got a pretzel problem, and I'm about to straighten it out. Hahaha, you see? 'Cause their pretzels, their twisted, their not straight. It's- You like that one Perry the Platypus? I've been saving it up. (Perry twists around in his trap, and using the mist that got stuck to his head, he rips off the sheet tying him down. He then launches himself at Doofenshmirtz, and causes the -inator the fire off a few shots, hitting a girl with curly hair, a yoga class, and a roller coaster) 
(Buford continues to run away from the fireside girls, but unfortunately trips over a log, sending him tumbling to the edge of the lake, where he spots Phineas and Ferb's super sprinkler)
Phineas: Hey Buford, what do you think of our super sprinkler? We used low turbulence mechanics, and specific gravity to make the water hold its shape while in motion.
Buford: You had me at super sprinkler.
Brigitte: There he is!
Isabella: Get 'em girls!
Brigitte: You cannot escape!
(Buford jumps into the water, and rides up the super sprinkler)
Brigitte: You think I am afraid of a little water, bear? Think again! (Brigitte runs after Buford)
Buford: What the-?! Aw man.
Isabella: She is really serious about getting this patch.
Josette and Collette: Oui.
Buford: (To Baljeet) Where have you been?
Baljeet: Dude, it is not my problem.
Phineas: Ferb, did you order a bear?
(Ferb says something, but it is muffled by his snorkel)
Phineas: Oh man, that would have been so funny without the snorkel.
Brigitte: Move it or lose it!
Buford: (He comes to the end of the super sprinkler) It just stops? How is that possible?
Brigitte: There is nowhere left to run bear!
Buford: No! No! Don't look at me.
Brigitte: Buford? 
(Perry wraps Doofenshmirtz in his blanket, then spins him into the -inator, setting it off, and destroying it)
Doofenshmirtz: See? Another reason to hate twisting. Curse you Perry the Platypus. (The De-Twist-inator blows up) 
(A ray from the -inator hits Phineas and Ferb's super sprinkler, straightening it out, making everybody fall)
Brigitte: Buford!
Buford: No! I'm not me! I'm somebody else!
Brigitte: Buford, I know it is you, but why would hide from me?
Buford: (He sighs heavily) Oh, Brigitte, I've spent years building up my tough-guy street cred. I can bounce back from the fuzzy bear suit, but being in love with a beautiful, sweet, exotic girl like yourself... If people found out about that, my image would be fini
Brigitte: Oh, Buford, you silly boy. I'm a well-bred, refined European. I would never let the Fireside Girls know that I was vaguely interested in a brute such as you. In fact, (She slaps Buford across the face) au revoir. (She swims away)
Baljeet: You okay buddy?
Buford: (Dreamily) She said she was vaguely interested in me. 
(Scene starts outside of the Flynn-Fletcher home. In the backyard, Linda's working on a junk sculpture and currently is using a blowtorch)
Phineas: Hey, Mom. Whatcha doin'?
Linda: Hey, boys. I'm just working on my junk sculpture for the Modern Installations by Moms charity auction.
Phineas: Cool! Seen Dad?
Linda: Oh, he headed out for that speaking engagement of his.
Phineas: Aw, we're gonna shoot darts and we thought he might want to play around.
Linda: Maybe next time. 
(In Candace's room, Candace is typing something on her computer)
Candace: What a racket! Those guys are so busted.
(blowtorch crackling)
(Candace gets off her chair then walks off)
I can't believe Mom isn't hearing this. 
(In the backyard, Linda stops wielding and then lifts up the protection mask)
Linda: Wow, I've really got a knack for this modern art stuff. I need to go get more materials! (drops the blowtorch; runs off)
(Candace opens the slider then walks into the backyard)
Candace: So, mid-crime, huh?
(Looks at the junk sculpture which she thinks Phineas and Ferb had made. Camera then pans back to show the entire backyard.)
They'll be back. 

(In the front yard, Phineas and Ferb are on a giant dart when Isabella goes to join them)
Isabella: Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Oh, hey, Isabella! We're playing giant darts!
Isabella: (flirtatiously) I bet you'll get a bulls-eye.
Phineas: (obliviously) Sure. Maybe not on the first try. It's all about little adjustments. And Buford and Baljeet are manning the target across town. 
(Across town, Baljeet's been pulling a cart with a giant target on it.)
Baljeet: Tell me again how you are helping?
Buford: (lounging on a beach chair) I'm supervisin'! 
(Back in the front yard)
Phineas: All right, here we go! Elevation, 33 degrees. Three, two, one...
Isabella: Have fun!
(Just after the giant dart leaves, Linda's backing her car down the driveway)
Linda: Hi, Isabella.
Isabella: Hi, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher. 
(Scene shifts to Phineas and Ferb flying in the air on the giant dart)
Phineas: With our current velocity and wind resistance, we should be nearing the target in no time.
(The giant dart flies past a sign for Honest Guy Used Cars. A hand on the sign then breaks off.)
Phineas: Whoops! Better retract the launch mechanism.
(He does so as the giant dart passes by D.E.I.) 
(Scene shifts to Lawrence driving to his speaking engagement.)
Lawrence: Let's see, where to. Ah, yes. 9019, Palindrome Road.
(Camera pans to the previously seen sign. The broken cardboard hand falls off of it, lands on the road, and a piece of paper drops out of the sun visor. Lawrence then hits the aforementioned item and his car starts to tip over.)
Lawrence: Oh! That was close. (rights the car back up) Whoops! Dropped my address. (picks up the paper) Well, (places paper on the sun visor) 6106, Palindrome Road, here I come! 
(Across town, Baljeet shields his eyes and spots the giant dart, which is currently off-screen)
Baljeet: Phineas and Ferb at ten o'clock!
Phineas: Oops. Outer ring. We'll try again.
Buford: Zero. Write that down, Baljeet.
(The launch mechanism on the giant dart crawls away)
Baljeet: Oh, yes, by all means, I do not want to forget to add zero later.
Phineas: Hey, I meant to ask you earlier. Where's Perry? 
(Scene shifts to the backyard where Perry's taking a nap near one of his entrances. His wrist communicator beeps and he wakes up with a gasp. He goes into agent mode while a piece of the siding opens. The teal-furred monotreme then rolls into the entrance and lands in his chair with a back-flip.)
Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. Our sources tell us that the members of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.,

are about to gather to elect their new leader. But we don't know where or how. See if you can gain access, and we'll survey the situation remotely through your wrist communicator.
(Perry presses a button, straps on his jet-pack, then leaves his lair) 
(The following scene is a phone conversation between Linda, driving in her car, and Candace, who's still in the backyard)
Candace: (on her cell phone) Mom, you've gotta see what Phineas and Ferb made. I don't know what it is, but it looks horrible.
Linda: I'll be home right after I finish my errands.
Candace: But you gotta come home now before it disappears!
Linda: (imitating static) What's that? You're breaking up! (imitates static) 
(In the backyard)
Candace: Wait! Mom! (growls) I hates when she does... (imitates static) ...but it doesn't matter. I'm not going anywhere. 
(Meanwhile, Perry, flying on his jet-pack, has arrived at D.E.I. He unbuckles from the jet-pack, leaps through a two-paneled window, and falls into a tube.)
Doofenshmirtz: (laughs) Right in there.
(Perry lands into the trap... a large empty bottle)
You've heard of a ship in a bottle? Well, you're Perry the Platypus in a bottle. (picks up bottle) Anyway, today is the day I become the supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.! You remember L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally... (mumbling) Whatever?
(Close-up of Perry)
Huh? Remember them?
(Camera pans back)
Well, we gotta moving. (holds up bottle) Maybe we'll get some hot dogs or something on the way. (walks off) You like hot dogs, right? 
(Back in the backyard, Candace is now sitting by the junk sculpture)
(thudding)
Candace: (gasps; stands up) That came from the front yard! (runs off) Phineas and Ferb!
(Linda walks into the backyard, carrying items for the junk sculpture) 
(In the front yard, the giant dart is getting ready for its second launch. It leaves just as Candace opens the front door.)
Candace: A-ha! Huh?
(drill whirring)
(gasps) Backyard! (slams door closed) 
(Linda's now backing out of the driveway for the second time)
Linda: Feathers. It needs feathers. 
(Candace is back in the now empty backyard)
Candace: (gasps) Oh. My. Gosh. 
(Scene shifts to the Danville Arena, and Lawrence is driving towards the parking lot)
Lawrence: (stops his car) Well, this is the place.

Lawrence: Yes, um, I'm supposed to be onstage?
Man: (puts paper down) They're about to get started. (pushes Lawrence towards stage) Go, go, go!

our contestants will each receive a commemorative flashlight...

Of course, considering his genial nature,...
(Close-up of Monogram on Perry's wristwatch communicator)

Announcer: Remember, points will be awarded by the audience,...
(Camera pans to some of the audience, all holding a voting device )
...so get out your voting boxes.
(Camera pans back to the announcer)
Our first evil event, the mechanical mother.
(Camera pans to the right. A trap door opens to reveal the aforesaid robot then it pans to show the three contestants.)
Show us how you treat the old lady, Larry!
Lawrence: Wish me luck, boys. (at the mechanical mother) Hello, old dear, so lovely to see you. (bows) I've brought you some peonies. (pulls out a bouquet)
Mechanical mother: Oh, such a nice boy.
(audience laughing)
(Camera pans to Doofenshmirtz and Rodney)
Rodney: I didn't think anyone could be more incompetent at being evil than you.
Doofenshmirtz: Me neither.
(Close-up of a worried Perry)
Announcer: And now, he's serving her tea without a trace of irony!
(Perry gives a sigh of relief. The camera then pans back to Doofenshmirtz and Rodney)
Lawrence: (as he walks back) Remember to keep that foot elevated. (to the other two) What a lovely, old girl.
Rodney: Prepare yourself for a stunning display of filial beastliness. (walks away)
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, knock yourself out, Rodney.
Rodney: (holding a present; at the mechanical mother) Hello, Mother. (kneels on one knee) I've brought you something special!
(Audience booing; Rodney stands up)
Mechanical mother: For me? (opens present) You're such a good...
(Close-up of the present, which has dirty laundry in it)
Announcer: Ooh! Dirty laundry!
(Close-up of the mechanical mother)
And there go the waterworks.
(Mechanical mother "cries"; audience cheers)
Rodney: (chuckles) Yeah. That's how it's done, boys.
Mechanical Mother: Oh! My baby still needs me!
Rodney: Huh?
Announcer: Oh, no! Tears of joy? Zero points for that move!
Doofenshmirtz: Ooh, you monster. Watch and learn, Rodney. (clears throat; at mechanical mother) I am getting married again.
(Doofenshmirtz walks off and then the mechanical mother explodes.)
(Close-up of the audience)
Announcer: Audience, get your votes in, please.
(Camera pans to the scoreboard. And at the end of event 1, it's Doofenshmirtz in the lead with 146 points, followed by Rodney with 2 and Lawrence with zero.)
Lawrence: (at a smug Doofenshmirtz) I don't know how you did it! I don't even think I understood the event, but good show!
(Doofenshmirtz blows a raspberry at Rodney)
Announcer: And we're back with everyone's favorite, the swimwear competition! Here comes Lawrence Fletcher...
(Camera pans to the stage and the black curtains open)
...wearing swim attire inspired by the legendary Klimpaloon,...
(A grinning Lawrence comes on stage, wearing an old-fashioned swim attire and holding a beach ball with one hand. He then places the beach ball on his head.)
...the magical old-timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas! Watch out for that Yeti, Larry!
(Lawrence bows while the audience applauds)
Next up is Heinz Doofenshmirtz.
(Doofenshmirtz comes out wearing a Speedo, towel, and roller skates, slipping towards the stage)
Doofenshmirtz: Wait, I thought this was the talent competition! (skates off balance; falls head first into a toilet; muffled yelling) It won't stop flushing!
(audience laughs)
Announcer: (pause) And last is Rodney in his... (curtain opens) Oh, my gosh!
Rodney: (growls)
(audience gasps)
Rodney: (leaps out of tank; removes rubber mask) Technically, it is a swimsuit.
(Camera pans to the scoreboard. And at the end of event 2, it's now a tie between Doofenshmirtz and Rodney with 342 points while Lawrence is finally on the board with 8. Perry gives a sigh of relief.) 
(Backyard; Candace's looking at the junk sculpture)
Candace: Meat? What possible functionality could that have? 
(Scene shifts to the backstage at the Arena, where Doofenshmirtz walks out of one of the changing rooms)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, come on, Rodney, the last event's about to... What? Wait, that's my Make-Everything-Evil-inator!
Rodney: No, Doofy, it's my Make-Everything-Evil-izer. It's an -Izer.
Doofenshmirtz: You're a jerk, you know that?
Rodney: Yes! And I'm going to be more of one when I zap myself with this! (pulls on a lever) I'll be so evil there'll be no way I can lose!
Doofenshmirtz: (quickly sits on Rodney's lap) I'll zap me first!
(A fight then starts between the two evil scientists)
(with Rodney) You quit it!
(Doofenshmitz then breaks off the lever)
Rodney: You broke my Izer!
Doofenshmirtz: Inator! Inator!
Rodney: Shut it!
Doofenshmirtz: No, you shut it!
(Just then, Lawrence walks out of another dressing room)
Lawrence: Have you seen these flashlights...AAH!
(Lawrence gets zapped by the ray, falls through the curtain, and somehow arrives on the stage. He turns on a flashlight, turns around, then laughs deviously. The camera pans to a worried Rodney and Doofenshmirtz.)
Rodney, Doofenshmirtz: Uh-oh. 
(In the backyard, two delivery men has arrived to take the junk sculpture away)
Delivery Man: Excuse us. We're here to take, uh this... thing away.
Candace: (stands up from lawn) What? No!
Delivery Man: Sorry, kid. We got a work order right here.
Candace: No! Nooooo! 
(Scene shifts to the Arena where the third and final event is about to begin)
Announcer: And now the final event where each of our three contestants will attempt to intimidate the others with only the force of his evil glare. Contestants, take your marks.
(The trio does so, each moving to a different place on the stage.)
Get set. And begin!
(audience cheers)
The voting has started! Look at those fingers go!
(Close-up of the scoreboard then of Rodney)
Rodney is off to an early lead. It's the pointy-ear advantage! But wait! What's this?
(Close-up of Lawrence)
Fletcher has his eyes covered. He's not even trying!
(Perry gives a sigh of relief)
Announcer: This could be a real opportunity for Doofenshmirtz!
(Close-up of Doofenshmirtz's face and then Rodney's)
He leers at Rodney. Rodney returns it. With a point! A classic gambit!
(Camera pans to the scoreboard)
The scores are really ticking up now and... Wait! There's a stirring in the Fletcher corner.
(Another close-up of Lawrence, but this time his hand's shaking)
Something's happening...
(A white light appears and after Lawrence removes his hand, Doofenshmirtz gasps in shock)
Doofenshmirtz: Such evil!
(Lawrence then looks at Rodney)
Rodney: (shielding his face) Oh! My eyes!
Announcer: And the crowd is going wild! Fletcher's numbers are skyrocketing!
(Camera pans to a worried Perry, and then his wristwatch communicator starts beeping)
Major Monogram: (on wristwatch communicator) Agent P, our sensors reveal that Lawrence Fletcher has been shot with a Make-Everything-Evil-izer. If he should become the supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., we will have no choice but to reassign you. You must find a way to snap him out of it. Remind him of his true, good nature. Remind him who he used to be!
(Perry straps on his jet-pack then blasts his way out of the glass bottle. When he reaches outside, the sky is beginning to darken.)
Phineas: (off screen) This is the one, Bro. I can feel it.
(Perry tips the tail end of the giant dart, which changes its course to the Danville Area. Inside, the announcer puts a medal on Lawrence's neck.)
Announcer: I now present to you, the new supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., Lawrence Fletcher!
Lawrence: Today, Danville! Tomorrow, the world! (chuckling)
Doofenshmirtz: We have term limits in L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., right?
Rodney: Nope.
Lawrence: (laughs evilly)
(Just then, the giant dart comes flying in and...)
Phineas: Bull's-eye!
(Lawrence continues to evilly gloat then the camera pans to Phineas and Ferb)
Phineas: I think that's Dad.
Ferb: What was the topic of his lecture again?
Phineas: Hi, Dad!
(Lawrence turns around and when he sees the boys, he stops with the evil laughter. Then flashbacks from previous episodes are being shown.)
Lawrence: (taking off medal; flings it away) Phineas! Ferb! What are you doing here?
(Perry gives a sign of relief then takes off on his jet-pack)
Lawrence: (shaking Phineas's hand) Brilliant shot, by the way.
Phineas: Aah, it's all about little adjustments.
(Close-up of the medal then the camera pans to Doofenshmirtz and Rodney)
Doofenshmirtz, Rodney: Mine! Mine! Mine!
(The two evil scientists start fighting and arguing over the medal)
Rodney: It's mine!
Doofenshmirtz: Ooh! I hate you!
Phineas: (as he, Ferb, and Lawrence walk away) So, how'd it go, Dad?
Lawrence: I'm not absolutely sure, boys, but I think I just became "King of the Pharmacists".
(Perry, in pet mode, is waiting for the boys and Lawrence at the exit)
Phineas: Awesome! (at Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry. 
(At the Flynn-Fletcher home, the junk sculpture is currently lying on the back of a flatbed truck. One of the delivery men is holding back a stubborn Candace, who still thinks Phineas and Ferb has built it.)
Candace: (grunts) No! Not until Mom has seen it.
Delivery Man: Sorry, miss, I got a job to do.
Linda: Candace is right. Because it's not done yet.
(Camera shows a crazed-looking Candace while Linda climbs onto the flatbed. Linda then places a coat hanger on the sculpture.)
Linda: There. Take it away, guys. That junk sculpture should bring in big bids at the auction. (climbs down the flatbed)
Candace: (in surprise) Junk sculpture?! (stuttering)
(The flatbed truck drives down the driveway)
Linda: Honestly, Candace, it's not like lip-synching is my only talent.
Candace: (continues stuttering)
Linda: Well, now you're just being rude. 
(Scene opens up at a store called "Stor". Baljeet is at the check-out counter with underpants)
Baljeet: Another week's allowance replacing wedgied underwear. If I had anything left, I would invest in the company.
Buford: (runs into the store and gives Baljeet a wedgie) Wedgie time! Thanks for savin' my place in line, nerd!
Baljeet: (annoyed) Buford, how did you find me?
Buford: Let's just say the initials are G, P, and S.
Grocer: Next!
Buford: (handing up his items) A pack of Tuff Gum, and this cheese grater.
Baljeet: What is the cheese grater for?
Buford: You'll see.
Grocer: $4.86. Paper or plastic?
Buford: Plastic. Pay the man, propeller-head.
Baljeet: (growls) That is it! I can put up with noogies, wedgies, wet willies, and even the fact that you apparently have placed a tracking device on, or inside, my person, but I will not tolerate your ignorant decision to take plastic over paper! From this moment on, I am no longer your nerd!! (storms out)
Buford: Aaah, fine! I was feeling creatively stifled by you anyway! (at grocer) And you! You just cost me a perfectly good nerd! Maybe I'll make you my new nerd.
Grocer: 'Wow. Your pressure tactics are quite developed for a youngster.
Buford: Yes. Yes, they are. But some people...don't APPRECIATE THAT!
Grocer: Y-you may be the most intimidating person I-I've ever met.
Buford: You better believe it!
Doofenshmirtz: (pops up from behind a nearby stand)
Grocer: You could probably bully the entire Tri-State Area!
Doofenshmirtz: (excitedly) I'm getting tingly! 
(Switches to the Flynn-Fletcher house as Baljeet skips jubilantly into the backyard, singing)
Baljeet: ♪ Oh, free! I am so free ♪
♪ Free to be me ♪
♪ It is me, that is free ♪
Phineas: Hey, Baljeet. You're just in time for what we want to do today. Where's Buford?
Baljeet: Who cares? I am finally free to live my own life! I feel like I can do anything! Like...climb a mountain!
Phineas: Great! Let's put that energy to work building our next--
Baljeet: No, I mean literally climb an actual mountain! Danville Mountain!
Phineas: Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Hey, where's Perry? 
(Switches to Perry's lair entrance. Perry sips from a garden hose as the hose forms a puddle deep enough to drop him into his lair)
Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P. We've just received some intel that Doof has hired an assistant. Some muscle, if you will. He must be up to something big. You know, I once put in a request for some muscle. Got Carl.
Carl: And how many attacks since I came on board?
Major Monogram: Well, none, but, would it kill you to at least look the part? You look like a preschool crossing guard.
Carl: No need to be hurtful, sir.
Major Monogram: Good luck, Agent P. 
(Switches to a dry cleaners store)
Buford: I can see I'll be helping you take over the Tri-State Area; would afford me many new bullying opportunities. But what's with the back-story, dude? I mean, who needs a special reason to boss people around?
Doofenshmirtz: I never thought of it like that. We'll get started as soon as I pick up some fresh lab coats. These have got scorch marks all over them.
Buford: (starts pushing people out of line) Out of my way, melonheads! Move it, or never use it!
Doofenshmirtz: Wow, this kid's always on the clock!
(Perry steps in, but quickly hides upon seeing Buford)
Buford: Give Dr. Toothenhurtz here his lab coats, Bright Eyes!
Cashier: I'm sorry, we have a line here. You might want to use it.
Buford: And you might wanna rethink that! I mean, it would be a shame if this double-Dutch chocolate mocha espresso you've been drinking, were to, say, I don't know, splishy-splash all over those prissy-clean lab coats you've got back there.
Customer in line: Hold me!
Cashier: You wouldn't dare!
Buford: Try me.
(the two stare at each other; the latter being angry, while the former being frightened)
Doofenshmirtz: (gasps)
Cashier: Fine! Take your dry-cleaning and go!
Doofenshmirtz: (as they walk off down the street while Perry watches nervously) Who would've thought that after all these years, all I needed to take over the Tri-State Area was a grammar-school goon. A ham-handed half-pint. A knee-high ne'er-do-well. A pint-size palooka. A pushy prepubescent.
Buford: Are you done?
Doofenshmirtz Nah, I've got one more. (beat) A pipsqueak pugilist. Okay, now I'm done. 
(At the foot of Danville mountain)
Baljeet: There it is. Danville Mountain. My quest lies ahead of me like an unpeeled potato.
Phineas: We can help you skin that adventure spud! May we present, the MegaPants! (Ferb pulls out a blueprint) Y'see, these hydraulic pistons will walk-
Baljeet: No! I need to do this myself. And that means no inventions.
(The blueprint slips from Ferb's hands as his irises shrink)
Phineas: (pause) What?
Baljeet: No gadgets, no gimmicks, just pure achievement! It will be great! Let us go! (begins running up the mountain)
Isabella: No inventions. Are you guys gonna be okay?
Phineas: (as she also runs up the mountain) Sure! Why wouldn't we be? 
(A montage plays in which Buford intimidates anyone standing in Doofenshmirtz's path, including a man about to park in the only available parking space, a man hosing the sidewalk in front of them, and a bird casting its shadow on Doof as he sunbathes) 
(As the gang approaches a rope bridge)
Phineas: I don't know. That rope bridge looks a little rickety. A couple of hydrochloric unicycles would-
Baljeet: Not necessary! (He runs onto the bridge) Fear is for yesterday. Today we live!
Isabella: New Baljeet rocks!
(The rope bridge snaps and Baljeet falls out of sight, screaming)
Isabella: ...Rocked.
(Baljeet uses the broken rope as a vine and swings up to the opposite bank)
Phineas: He made it! Well, with the bridge gone, we could probably use some spring-loaded boots! (rubs hands in anticipation) Or a drilling machine! Or...or-
Baljeet: I'll save you! (swings across the river, catches them all, and they all swing back to the other bank) Who is ready for some free climbing?
Isabella: Me!
(Ferb puts his hand on Phineas' shoulder and they begin walking again) 
(Doofenshmirtz and Buford walk into Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc., where a model of the Tri-State Area is on a table in the middle of the room)
Buford: Dude, what's with the playset?
Doofenshmirtz: Playset? No, this is a non-scale model of the Tri-State Area.
Buford: So you play with dolls?
Doofenshmirtz: (as Perry jet-packs onto the balcony and hides in the rafters) Maaaybe.....but it also helps me visualize my scheme, it doesn't have to be used with dolls.....all the time. A-anyway, this is our headquarters, larger for the sake of clarity, and this, see this right here? This is my Sculptinator. This part will scan my body, and this part will shoot a beam which will then carve Danville Mountain into a lifelike statue of me! (lifts up the model of the mountain to reveal a model of a statue of him, but the statue has a lot of muscles) Visible for literally miles in every direction! Not scale miles, real miles. And then, when people see this splendid tower of manliness, they will just assume that I should be their leader. Look! Look how it captures the manly thickness of my neck.
Buford: (skeptically) That's you?
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah.
Buford: I think the cut of your lab coat is working against you.
Doofenshmirtz: I know, right? I've got to talk to my tailor about that.
Buford: Look, there's Baljeet's house! I'm gonna spit on it.
Doofenshmirtz: (as Buford drops a gob of spit on the plastic model of Baljeet's house) Y'know, I'm kind of surprised that we haven't had a visit from my nemesis yet. (Switch to show Perry hiding in the rafters, looking deeply uncomfortable) I'm sure he'll be along. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he gets a load of you. 
(On Danville Mountain. Baljeet is at the head of the group, wearing a harness to which Isabella's, Ferb's and Phineas' harnesses are attached as they climb below)
Phineas: Hey, Baljeet! You sure you don't need any robotic suction spikes up there?
Baljeet: Nope!
Phineas: Or how about mechanical lobster claws?
Baljeet: No-ope!
(Camera pans down to show that Phineas is curled up in a ball, dangling from Ferb's harness as he desperately offers invention ideas)
Phineas: Or maybe gas-propelled pine cone grappling hooks? Or cybernetically controlled towing spiders?
Baljeet: I am good! 
(At Doofenshimrtz Evil Inc.)
Doofenshmirtz: Surprise! Matching outfits! It's John Phillips of London Bullywear. Plus, monogrammed jet-packs! Doof and Byoof! We rhyme.
Buford: Gee, thanks a lot! Wait till my friends get a load of me!
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, you're not gonna need friends. You're gonna be on top of the heap! It's lonely at the top, but, you know, it's the top, so it dulls the ache. (He walks away. Buford looks surprised) 
(On Danville Mountain. Baljeet climbs onto the top)
Baljeet: YES! I have BEAT you, Danville Mountain! In your cliff face! Ha ha! I cannot wait to tell Buf- oh. That is right.
(The other kids emerge onto the top)
Isabella: Okay. That's enough triumph for one day. Are we done here, Baljeet?
Baljeet: Yes...
Isabella: Phineas, go!
Phineas: ICE CHALET!!!!! (He instantly zooms offscreen and the sounds of drilling and hammering are heard)
Ferb: If we hadn't been able to invent something soon, I was going to scream. (He and Isabella walk over to join Phineas, leaving Baljeet alone)

Buford: Sorry, Dr. Dooftinasian. But there comes a time when you don't wanna bully everyone. (He looks back dramatically, with a single tear falling from his eye) You just wanna bully someone you love.
(He flies away on his jet-pack)
Doofenshmirtz: Nice kid. Well, back to the inator-
(Perry swings down from the rafters and punches him, knocking him over) 
(On the mountain. Phineas is still doing things frantically)
Phineas: Okay! We gotta melt out the inside!
Isabella: You know, you really ought to pace yourself!
Phineas: Mudroom first! Ferb, start carving the bearskin rug!
Isabella: You're gonna get the bends or something. 
(At Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ha! (slams down the Sculptinator start button, then poses) You're too late, Perry the Platypus! Ooh! Make sure to get my good side!
(Perry punches him in the face just as the Sculptinator shoots, making Doofenshmirtz's carving to be of his upturned face with a grotesque expression. The ice chalet is resting on the very tip of his carving's nose, although they don't know this)
Doofenshmirtz: No, Perry the Platypus, aww, you've ruined it! Where am I gonna get another mountain now? (Perry kicks him again and he goes over) 
(Inside the ice chalet)
Isabella: Great job on the snow chalet, guys! It's amazing how the cocoa stays hot in these double wall ice cups. How are you feeling, Phineas?
Phineas: (in an ice hot tub) Coming down now, coming down.
Baljeet: I myself am so down, I am in the basement. (The GPS button on his overalls starts blinking and Buford enters) Buford!
(Baljeet jumps up from the table and runs over to greet Buford)
Buford: As much as I'd like a tearful reunion, we gotta get off this mountain pronto!
Baljeet: Why?
(The neck of Doofenshmirtz's carving begins to crumble and the whole top of the mountain carving begins to tremble)
Buford: Let's just say if you want a neck like mine, you gotta start lifting young.
Baljeet: Before any of us move, I have got one last thing to do.
(It looks like he's going in for a hug, but he actually gives Buford a massive wedgie. Buford screams)
Baljeet: There, I feel much better. Do not you?
Buford: Wow. I had no idea that was so uncomfortable. I am so sorry.
(The ice chalet starts shaking harder)
Isabella: It's been great sharing this bonding moment with you two, but we need to get off this crumbling mountain now!
Phineas: Grab hold of something!
(The ice chalet bursts and everybody ends up grabbing onto Buford's now-parachute like underwear)
Buford: Do you ever get used to this?
Baljeet: Nope!
Isabella: I am totally gonna wash my hands after this. Twice. 
(Back in D.E.I., Perry uses the scale model of the mountain and activates the Sculptinator to return it to normal)
Doofenshmirtz: (sounding bored) Who could've guessed it? It's back to normal. And explosion now. (Kaboom!) Yep. Just like that. Curse you, Perry the Platypus. Whatever.
♪ Perry! ♪ 
(The gang lands in the boys' backyard)
Baljeet: I am sorry for my outburst, earlier.
Buford: No. I'm sorry for putting the GPS on you. Consider it gone!
(He rips the GPS button off Baljeet's overalls and they fall down around his ankles)
Baljeet: Oh, yes. This is much less humiliating.
Buford: Don't worry. I'll get the duct tape. (He leaves)
Baljeet: He meant...for my pants, right? 
The scene opens in the backyard)
Phineas: You know what, Ferb? This is gonna be the most interesting thing we've ever built.
Ferb: And the tallest.
Phineas: Yes, and the tallest.
Ferb: And the heaviest.
Phineas: Wow, we're chatty today, aren't we? 
(In Candace's room)
Candace: (on the "phone") I know, Stace, I can't believe I lost another one! I'll go out of my mind without it!
Linda: (knocks on the door then opens it) Candace, I've got something for you.
Candace: Stacy, I gonna have to call you back. My new phone is here. (reveals her "phone" is actually her hand) Wee! Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! (receives her phone) So, how many apps does it run? Can I play MP3s and send texts to Stacy the same time? How 'bout... Hey, wait a minute. All this phone does is...make phone calls!
Linda: Sorry, Candace. You've lost four phones in four months, so I got you the cheapest replacement I could find. If you lose this one, it's life without a phone for Candace Flynn. (walks away)
Candace: "Life without a phone for Candace Flynn"? But...but that's me!
Phineas: (outside) Fire in the hole! (explosion)
Candace: Phineas and Ferb, will you keep... (trips over a rug and the cell phone falls out of the window) NOOO!
(The cell phone lands on a soft pile of leaves. She then looks out of the window.)
Oh! Well, how about that? It's all right. 
Contractor: Hey, kid, where do you want me to leave these ridiculously heavy bars?
Phineas: Just set them down over there somewhere.
(the contractor truck drops the box down over the cell phone)
Candace: Not on my phone!
Phineas: On second thought, bring 'em over here.
Contractor: Sure thing, kid.
(the truck drives over the cell phone, breaking it even more)
Phineas: Thanks a lot.
Contractor: No sweat, kid.
(drives over the cell phone again)
Candace: AAAAHH!! It's blinking. Maybe it's still okay!
Contractor: Oh, hey. I need you to sign this invoice.
(drives over the cell phone again)
Phineas: Okay. And here...you go.
Contractor: Thanks, kid.
(drives over the cell phone again)
Contractor: Oh, forgot my pen.
(drives over the cell phone again)
Phineas: Here you go.
Contractor: Thanks kid.
(drives over the cell phone again)
Contractor: It had a cap.
Phineas: Oh, sorry.
Contractor: Take it easy, kid.
(drives over the cell phone again) 
Candace: (runs down to the backyard) Oh, no! Phonsie! Oh, what've they done to you? (picks up the phone's debris) Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Phineas: I can hear you, Candace.
Candace: Oh, great, it still works. (at the phone's debris) Yeah, Phineas, I was just telling you that...uh! (realizes)
Phineas: Oh no, is that your new cell phone?
Candace: It used to be. Wait a second. You guys are good with wires and gadgets and stuff. Can you fix it?
Phineas: Well, it took almost forty years to perfect the technology that makes the modern cell phone possible. So...give us thirty-eight minutes. (at Ferb) Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today, before we do the other thing that we were gonna do today. Hey, where's Perry? 
(In Perry's lair)
Major Monogram: Carl!
Carl: What?
Major Monogram: Look, I'm getting messages from some diabolically clever hacker, who goes by the sinister initials "TTYL".
Carl: Sir, that means "talk to you later". If you scroll down, you can see that message was from me.
Major Monogram: Oh, oh, I see. That's, uh, very clever.
(Perry lands on his chair)
Oh, good morning, Agent P. Uh...beat it, Carl. I'm on. (Carl leaves) Sources tell us that Doofenshmirtz's "ROTFL". We don't know what that means, but it sounds dangerous.
Carl: Sir, ROTFL means...
Major Monogram: Not now, Carl. I'm briefing Agent P. (at Perry) So get out there and good hunting. (Perry leaves)
Oh, no! Carl, now it just says q-q-q-q-q-q-q.
Carl: It means your thumb is on the Q-key sir.

(Ferb reveals a video projector) You just say the words, "Go to", and then specify the name or place you're trying to reach, and the phone will take you there. Allow me to demonstrate. (at Isabella) Isabella, would you go stand over there on the driveway, please?
Isabella: Sure, Phineas. (leaves)
Buford: She's gone. Let's talk about her.
Baljeet: Focus, Buford.
Isabella: (on the driveway) Ready spaghetti!
Phineas: (to the cell phone) Go to Isabella.
Cell Phone: Isabella, located.
(Phineas transports to Isabella at a range where their noses appear to be touching)
Isabella: Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: I'm transporting. (to the phone) Go to garage.
Cell Phone: Garage, located.
(Phineas transports back the garage)
Isabella: Dang it!
Buford: So, then, Phineas was all like... (Phineas reappears) I'll finish my story later.
Phineas: And that's how it works.
Candace: Okay, Phineas. Thirty-eight minutes is up.
Phineas: But, Candace, you really should see our interactive tutorial.
Candace: The only thing that I wanna see is you later.
(rim shot on the cell phone) What was that?
Phineas: That was the rim shot app. Are you sure you don't wanna watch the tutorial?
Candace: I'm a teenage girl. Nobody has to teach me how to use a cell phone. Now if you'll excuse me, me and little phonsie-wonsie have to make up for lost time. Okay? Yeah, we do.
Phineas: O-kaay. Let's get back to what we were doing before.
Buford: When we get there, let's talk about Candace.

Doofenshmirtz: Man, it's dark down here. (hits over something) Uh, ohh! Turn on the light, Heinz, you're not a bat. (turns on the light) Hey! It's Norm's old head, the original prototype! I wonder if it still works.
Old Norm Head: (sarcastic) Oh, great, look who's here. It's Dr. Doof-degree-purchased-on-the-Internet-with-my-wife's-money-enshmirtz.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, I must say it's good to hear your voice again, too, after so long! I just came down here to get some parts for my new -inator.
Old Norm Head: Hey, take me with you. I haven't seen you blow yourself up for a long time.
Doofenshmirtz: All right, Mr. Smarty-pants. Come on, let's go.
Old Norm Head: Hey, on the way, let's swing by the store and get you some deodorant.
Doofenshmirtz: Quiet, you.
(The two hit over something again) 
(In the living room)
Candace: (on her new phone) Yeah, so, like, then I like had to go 38 minutes without a phone, and I was like, "You guys better fix it, or else!" and they were like, "Candace, you're the best big sister we've ever had!" and I was like "Yeah." and they were like "WOOAHEEEHH!"
Stacy: Candace, I'd love to hear more, and I'm sure I will, but right now I'm trying to finish this documentary on Easter Island. Man, I wish I could go.
Candace: Why would you ever want to go to Easter Island?
Cell Phone: Easter Island, located.
Candace: Stacy, what happened to your voice? (transports to Easter Island) Oh, how did I get here? PHINEAS AND FEEERB! 
(At Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.)
Doofenshmirtz: I've really got to hand it to myself, Norm's Old Head. I'm a genius!
Old Norm Head: Ohh, is that what you see? 'Cause I'm looking at a lab coat filled with Doonkleberries on top of which someone has strategically placed a cabbage.
Doofenshmirtz: This is my new -inator. I call it the Pick-'Em-Up inator.
Old Norm Head: Hm-mm; so what's this one do and where can I hide when it doesn't do it and blows up?
Doofenshmirtz: All I have to do is enter the coordinates and launch. (coughs)
(the -inator flies away) 
Vanessa: Ugh. I should've known Dad would be late. (the -inator landed over her and picks her up) Oh, what is this? Curse you, unknown rocket-helmet-transportation thing! (the Inator drops her at her house) Oh, sweet, I'm home. Never mind, unknown rocket-helmet-transportation thing! 
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, look, Old Norm Head. It worked. It functioned properly! Vanessa's all picked up and taken home, with three minutes to spare.
Old Norm Head: That's great. We can spend the rest of the day working on your personality. Hey, this time let's try to bump to a C minus.
Doofenshmirtz: You know, I'm starting to remember why I replaced you and put you in storage.
(Door crashes open and Perry enters)
Perry the Platypus? What? I didn't do anything wrong today. I just built an Inator to pick up my daughter. But, hey, as long as you're here, why don't you join me for my evil exercise show? I've got a spare headband.

(at Easter Island)
Candace: Easter Island? Who makes an app that sends people in Easter Island? (a bird grabs her cell phone) Hey, come back here! I need that to get home! (runs over a cliff) Aaaah! Oh, that was close. Talk about a cliffhanger.
(rim shot on the cell phone) 
(at Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.)
Doofenshmirtz: Can I get you a sports drink, Perry the Platypus? No? All right. Suit yourself. Say, as long as you're tied up, I'll tell you the evil plan I just thought of while we were working out. See, I figured my Pick-'Em-Up-Inator works so well; I could mass-produce them and pick up everyone in the Tri-State Area! (drinks the sports drink) Then, they would have to do what I tell them. Man, what is in this stuff? 
(at Easter Island)
Candace: Okay, bird! You better give me my phone or I'm gonna rock you to sleep...with a REAL rock!
(rim shot on the cell phone again) Ugh! 
(A turtle hears Candace and becomes Agent T, contacting Carl)
Carl: Yes? What is it, Agent T? (Agent T shows him) Oh no, that's Candace Flynn of the Flynn-Fletcher family.
Candace: (on the cliff) Phineas! Aaaaah!
Carl: I better notify Agent P. Good work, Agent T. 
(at Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.)
Doofenshmirtz: (reading the label) "Glycerol, glycerol, ester of rosin, yellow 15." I guess they had 14 other yellows.
(Perry sees Candace on Easter Island on his wristwatch communicator)
Doofenshmirtz: "Sucrose acetate, isobut."
(Perry hits his foot with a barbell)
Aaah! What was that about? Man, tie a guy up and he gets all foot-stompy on you for no reason!
(Perry activates the Pick-'Em-Up-Inator)
Old Norm Head: Hey, Perry the Platypus, could you do me a favor and leave that remote here?
Doofenshmirtz: Urgh. There, I'm better. Hey. Perry the Platypus, that's it? You're just gonna thwart and run?
(Perry tips his fedora and then leaves)
Curse you, Perry the... (his phone rings) Hello? Oh hi, Vanessa. Yes, that was my -inator. Listen, honey, I'm in the middle of something, hold on one second. (at Perry) ...PLATYPUUUS! (at Vanessa) So, how was class? 
(at Easter Island)
Candace: Oh, give me the phone, bird! (the bird pecks her) Aw, aww! Give me a break! (the twig breaks; rim shot on the cell phone again) AAAAAHHH!
(The Inator picks her up) AAAAHHH!
(she passes across the ocean, across a flock of birds, a giant wave, and outside the Earth) AAAAAAAHHHH! 
(In the backyard)
Phineas: Well, you were right, Ferb. The most interesting thing we ever built was very tall and very heavy. And the guy from the museum seemed very appreciative.
Ferb: I still can't believe it fit in his truck.
Candace: AAAAAAHHH! (lands beside them)
Phineas: Hey, Candace. Buford was just talking about you.
Candace: You guys are SOOOO busted! I'm calling Mom right now. Oh, no. I don't have the phone! (car honks) That's Mom! When she finds out I lost it, my life is ruined!
Phineas: Relax, Candace. We made two, just in case.
Candace: You did that for me?
Phineas: Well, sure.
Candace: Thank you. You do realize I'm still gonna have to bust you for making me go to Timbuktu?
Cell Phone: Timbuktu, located.
Candace: Meap. (disappears)
Phineas: She's gonna miss pie.
(Candace transports to Timbuktu)
Candace: PHINEAS AND FEEEERB! 
(Norm's Old Head lands on Easter Island by the Inator)
Old Norm Head: Finally, a place where a head can be a head. When's the bunny get here with all the eggs? Huh? Yeah, Easter Island? Huh? Huh? Oh, man, where's the bird with the rim shot app when you need him. 
(Scene opens with a view of the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Candace: Oh, Stacy, isn't Jeremy's hair the perfect shade of gold?
Recording: Uh huh.
Candace: And isn't it cute when he gets that little wrinkle on the end of his nose?
Recording: Uh huh.
Candace: And you know when...
Recording: Uh huh.
Candace: Stacy! Did you make a digital sound file of yourself saying "Uh huh" to fool me into thinking you're listening to me again?
Recording: Uh huh.
Candace: (Enraged) Stacy, pick up!
Stacy: (Picks up the phone) Well, do you blame me? (Imitating Candace) Oh, Jeremy and I went to the movies, Jeremy's house smells like gingerbread, ever notice Jeremy's mole is shaped like an adorable puppy? I'm starting to feel like the only reason you hang out with me is to talk about Jeremy!
Candace: Stacy, I--
Stacy: I miss you, Candace! I miss when we would spend time together, just the two of us. And I bet you didn't remember that today is the Danville Street Fair.
Candace: Stacy, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna cancel with Jeremy today. Meet me at the cafe in a half an hour and we'll hit the Street Fair afterwards. It'll be just the two of us. I promise.
Stacy: Really? Great! But no—Jeremy -- anything. Okay? If I even hear his name--
Candace: I promise I won't break this promise. See ya in a bit! (hangs up) Now, to call Jeremy. Wait, why call him, when I can tell him I can't see him today...in person? (runs off to do so) 
(Switches to Isabella)
Isabella: This is it, Isabella: The day you're going to insist on spending some time alone with Phineas! I can do this! (walks into backyard) What'cha doooin'?
Phineas: Hey, Isabella, we're building a giant robot dog.
Baljeet: Like when we made that title sequence!
Buford: Mmm, I'd rather give a monkey a shower.
Isabella: So, uh, Phineas, I was wondering if maybe after this, you'd like to go to the premiere of the new Stumbleberry Finkbat movie.
Phineas: (while rummaging through wires) Huh? Oh, sure. Sounds cool.
Ferb: (appears) I'd like to go to that.
Isabella: Uh, sorry, I -- I only have one extra ticket, and...it's sold out. So, I thought maybe Phineas and I would go—uh, not to necessarily exclude --
Phineas: Yeah, I can go after we finish up here. Done with he wiring, Ferb?
(Ferb produces a back scratcher and scratches the dog, causing its hind leg to rise and twitch)
Phineas: Lookin' good. Hey, where's Perry? 
(Switches to D.E.I., where Perry is already trapped by Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: Comfortable, Perry the Platypus? I've made that platy-rack so that every limb is accounted for. So, what's it all about?
(Flashback)
You see, there were only 2 things that made my miserable childhood bearable: my giant pet cockroach, Hoarfrost and garlic ice cream. I love these two things so much I wondered if combining them would exponentially increase my enjoyment of them.
(Flashback ends)
So, introducing my Combine-inator! With my Combine-inator, I was finally able to make the Triple Scoop Garlic Roach Cone!
Hoarfrost: So cold...
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah. (Doof frowns at his semi-disturbing creation and drops the garlic roach cone to the ground.)
Hoarfrost: Ow...
Doofenshmirtz: So anyway, I remembered this little island timeshare that I bought on a free trip to Vegas. And, I realized that if I were to combine my tiny island with the Capitol of the Tri-State Area like so, ta-da! Then, legally, under local property laws, I will be sovereign ruler of the Tri-State Area! As long as I file the appropriate paperwork and get it in by the end of business today...
(Perry turns the hairs on his head into the shape of a key and unlocks his trap, while Doofenshmirtz is still talking. Afterwards, the former punches the latter, sending the two offscreen) 
(Switches to Jeremy's house)
Candace: (rings doorbell)
Mrs. Johnson: (answers door) Oh, hello, Candace.
Candace: Hey, Mrs. Johnson. Is Jeremy in?
Mrs. Johnson: Come on in. He's right over there.
(Pan over to Jeremy sleeping on the couch holding a drumstick and milk jug.)
Candace: Is he okay?
Mrs. Johnson: Oh, sure. He was just up all night working the graveyard shift at Mr. Slushy Burger after a full day shift. Then when he came home...
Jeremy: (snoring)
Mrs. Johnson: He ate an entire turkey, drank a gallon of warm milk and just passed out on the sofa. Bless him. I'd be surprised if he woke up before next Thursday. Good luck getting any conversation out of him, sweetie.
Candace: Thanks. Aw, look how cute he is when he's sleeping. (sits next to Jeremy) Psst, Jeremy? 
(Switches back to D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Alright, you've asked for it! (grabs Perry and they roll on the ground, knocking over the Combine-inator. The contraption fires off a ray that reaches a nearby park)
Man: I hereby dedicate this giant prism--
(The ray hits the prism, causing the former to redirect into two directions: one straight up into space and hitting a satellite and the other in the direction of Jeremy's house)
Candace: ...so Stacy and I just need a little girl time, and that's a--
(The ray hits Candace and Jeremy, causing the two to be fused together at the waist)
Candace: Okay, that was weird... So, you'll have to take a raincheck, OK?
(Candace attempts to get up, but fails, due to Jeremy's weight keeping her from doing so. She then screams)
Candace: We're attached! Stacy's gonna kill me! (gets up and falls on the ground) Phineas and Ferb... 
(Switches back to the Flynn-Fletcher backyard. Isabella is getting impatient)
Phineas: Tail wag solenoids, check. Slipper chewing radio controlled by cuspids, check.
Isabella: (sighs) Hey, Phineas? What'cha still doooin'?
Phineas: Just going through a last minute checklist, now that the dog is done.
Isabella: Oh! Does that mean we can, uh, go to the movies?
Phineas: Hey Ferb! Let's fire this puppy up!
(Ferb turns the robot dog on)
Phineas: (to Isabella) I don't see why not.
Isabella: Great, we can still catch the matinee!
Candace: Phineas! (enters backyard) What have you done?!
Phineas: Well, we've made this giant robotic--
Candace: Just look at us! We are all fused together! (close up of her) See?! I don't care what kind of freaky project you guys are doing! Just get us unstuck!
Baljeet: We could remove you to a sterile environment and get a board certified surgeon to cleanly and safely preform a Jere-botomy.
Buford: We could tie each of you to a monster truck and drive in opposite directions. Worst-case scenario, someone loses a torso.
Phineas: Or, we can use the molecular separator.
Candace: That thing you used to separate me from me?
Phineas: Yeah! It worked before. You know, in a completely different set of circumstances.
Candace: Great you guys get on it. (Her phone rings) H-Hey Stacy.
Stacy: Hey BFF, just checking on your ETA.
Candace: About that-
Stacy: Oh no! You had better not be ditching me to hang out with Jeremy again!
Candace: What? On Street Fair day? Haha! No way, sister! I'll be there, and I'll be there early. Ah-haha. Yeah. Alone. Okay? Okay. (She hangs up) Oh crud. Make that molecular whatever and meet me at the coffee shop!
Isabella: Yeah, but the movie almost started --
Candace: (overlapping, leaves) And don't be late! THIS IS YOUR FAULT!
Phineas: I don't know what she's talking about Ferb, but I do know the next thing we're gonna do today! Let's get started on the separator.
(Isabella frowns) 
Doofenshmirtz: (Doofenshmirtz and Perry circle each other) So here we are, just the two of us at a stalemate. Each looking for something to turn the tide, but what will it be?
Norm: (He walks in carrying a large tray of cupcakes) Cupcakes?
Doofenshmirtz: Oop! Watch this! (He leaps on to the -inator, activating it, then jumps into Norm's arms) Prepare to face the wrath of Normenshmirtz! (Normenshmirtz fires laser at Perry) You can't get away from me now!
Norm: Don't you mean us?
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, don't step on my moment. 
Candace: Phineas and Ferb better find a fix for this—Oh!!
(Candace sees Stacy, and to hide Jeremy, she pulls up a chair, and throws a tablecloth over him)
Stacy: Hey girlfriend!
Candace: Oh hey Stace!
Stacy: (To the waiter) Two ice teas please. So, Candace, sorry I was so hard on you before. I know you and Jeremy aren't together all the time.
Candace: No, really it's okay. It's nice to have a little space from him. Oh look, our drinks.
Waiter: Two ice teas.
Candace and Stacy: Thanks.
(Jeremy snores) Candace: (She covers up Jeremy's lips to stop him from snoring) So, I hear there's a ton of vintage clothing stalls at the street fair this year.
Stacy: Yeah, I'm looking for some really cool... Wow, this table's really lumpy.
Candace: Yeah, lumpy tables. It's the new "hip" thing. It's so European.
Jeremy: (moaning) Uhhhh...
Candace: (desperately) Uhhh... ♪ Do the Moan, Moan! Yeah! Do the Moan! ♪ Come on, Stace, don't you love that song? ♪ Do the Moan! ♪
Candace: Hey isn't that that guy from that movie?
Stacy: What? Where? I don't see him! What guy?
Candace: (To Jeremy) ♪ Lullaby and goodnight da-da-da-da ♪
Stacy: I don't see anyone.
Candace: That's because he's gone.
Stacy: Candace, why are you acting so nervous? I'm not mad anymore. I'm going to go pay for our drinks. (She leaves)
Candace: Okay. (Stacy returns, and Candace has on a big overcoat to hide Jeremy) Ready?
Stacy: Candace, why are you wearing that coat?
Candace: Brr, that ice tea gave me a chill.
Stacy: Okay, let's go, but you're walking behind me.
Candace: Okie-doke! (She pulls out her phone) Phineas will you hurry? We're heading to the street fair already. 
(Normenshmirtz continues firing lasers at Perry, accidentally hitting the Combine-inator, fusing Perry with a nearby tool box.) Doofenshmirtz: I think we're in trouble.
Norm: Sure, now it's "we". 
Phineas: Ta-da! Representing the molecular separator! I can't believe how fast we rebuilt this Ferb. Of course breaking the immutable law of physics is always easier the second time around.
Isabella: Great! Does that mean we can go to the movies now?
Phineas: Sure does. The movie theatre is right next to the street fair. All we've got to do is get this to Candace, and separate her from Jeremy.
Isabella: Well what are we waiting for?
Ferb: I believe were waiting for Rover to put the molecular separator down. (Sure enough, while the kids were distracted, Rover picked up the contraption in his mouth and is now racing out the backyard gate.)
Isabella: Hey! (They chase after Rover)
Phineas: Come back here boy!
Buford: This would have never happened if we'd given a monkey a shower. I'm just sayin'.

(Toolbox-Perry unscrews one of Norm's arms)
Norm: Hey! That hurt!
Doofenshmirtz: Ahh! He's armed!
Norm: With my arm!
(Perry fires a couple of shots, then launches the arm at Normenshmirtz, who crashes into the Combine-inator, causing it to fire. It hits Perry, merging him with the trap. Normenshmirtz tries to get up, but they end up breaking the hammer)
Norm: Balsa wood?
Doofenshmirtz: It was on sale. It's locked into overload.
(The -inator begins firing, merging Normenshmirtz with a refrigerator.)
Norm: (Opening the door to the refrigerator) Would you like a nice, frosty beverage?
Doofenshmirtz: Hey! (He closes the door) That's private! 
(At the Street Fair)
Phineas: Split up guys. Maybe we can corner him.
Phineas and Isabella: (After cutting Rover off) A-ha!

Buford and Baljeet: A-ha!
Buford: He's coming your way! 
Candace: I'm running out of hiding places. (She spies a dressing room, and hides Jeremy behind the curtain)
Stacy: Hey! I found all kinds of cute things! Move over, I'm going to try them on.
Candace: No! Uh... I can see they fit you perfectly.
Stacy: Candace! Are you karate-chopping me?! What's going on? 
Phineas: Heel, boy! (Rover stops) Go Ferb! (Ferb runs up, and yanks a few wires out from Rover, causing him to shut down and drop the molecular seperator from his mouth)
Phineas: (Slow motion) No!
Candace: (Slow motion) No!
(Ferb blinks in slow motion)
Isabella and Buford: (Slow motion) No!
Baljeet: How is everyone doing that?!
(The molecular separator hits the ground, and sends out a field of separation) 
Doofenshmirtz: (Now disconnected) Hey, I can feel my knees again!
(Norm crashes on top of him)
Norm: I'm sorry.
(The refrigerator crashes on them both)
Doofenshmirtz: So cold... 
Candace: Okay, listen Stacy, there was this blast, and I was sitting next to Jeremy, and somehow we got--
Stacy: Jeremy. Jeremy. Jeremy. Tell me later I want to try this on.
(She opens the curtain)
Candace: Stacy, honest, I really wanted to spend the day with you but... (She notices that Jeremy isn't in the booth) But...? But? And we were? Uh... never mind. (Jeremy walks in from behind the booth, thoroughly confused)
Jeremy: Candace?
Candace: Jeremy!
Jeremy: I know this is a weird question, but do you have any idea how I got here?
Candace: Jeremy, don't worry, I promise I'll explain everything later, but right now you've gotta get out of here. (pushes him away) I'll call you later...I mean, tomorrow. Phew...
(Pause, then...)
Stacy: (peeks out from dressing room) By the way, the best part was when you used him as a table. (closes curtain) BUSTED! 
Isabella: So, we, uh, got everything sorted out now.
Phineas: Yeah, want to catch that movie?
Isabella: Oh Phineas... 
(The satellite discharges a Combine-inator beam) 
Phineas: (To Ferb) Okay, bro, I guess I'll see you back at the house.
(The beam hits Phineas and Ferb, fusing them)
Isabella: Oh. My. Gosh.
Phineas: Hey! Does this mean we can all go now?
Ferb: Yes. Yes it does. 
(Scene opens up showing the Flynn-Fletcher house.) 
(In Candace's room)
Candace: I've got a feeling that today is the day. Even as we speak, my brothers are planning something dangerous, disguised as playing cards! 
(Scene shifts to the backyard.)
Isabella: Well I'm out.
Phineas: Me too.
Buford: (Laughs) Losers.
Baljeet: (enters the backyard) Sorry, I'm late.
Phineas: That's okay. (at Ferb) Deal him in, Ferb.
Buford: Who came up with cards anyway?
Baljeet: They were invented by ancient Babylonian traders and merchants.
Ferb: (while shuffling the cards) Actually, the Babylonians had been defunct as a distinct culture for a millennium prior to the introduction of playing cards in India.
Baljeet: (Gasps) That is right! Three months of summer vacation and I am losing my edge!
Buford: Has it only been three months? 'Cause I've been adding up all of the things we built this summer, and we're way over 150!
Baljeet: Oh! My brain is atrophied! It needs exercise!
Phineas: Gang, I know what we're gonna do today!
Buford: And Perry?
Phineas: Who knows? 
(scene switches at Flynn-Fletcher Antiques.)
Lawrence: And here, we have a marvel 16th century wardrobe. We have one just like this when I was a schoolboy. And inside it was another land filled with magical woodland creatures.
Woman: Ohhh hohoho. You English and your fantasy worlds.
Lawrence: Ahahah. Can I show you some tables...
(Lawrence and the woman walks then Perry opens the box and grab his fedora and enters in the wardrobe. The wardrobe has some trees and snowing inside his lair.)
Major Monogram: Hello Agent P, sorry about the trees they were leftovers from Christmas and we didn't have anywhere else to store 'em. Oh, and uh, also the air-conditioning system is on the fritz, so pardon all the frost. All over the Tri-State Area, keys are disappearing. Businesses can't open, the freeways have ground to a halt, citizens are locked out of their homes, and I, for one, would really like to get into the executive washroom. It's got a waterfall, you know you wave your hand to the water just sort of-... well it's...it's really cool. Stop Doofenshmirtz! Quickly!
(Perry then leaves) 
(scene switches at the Flynn-Fletcher backyard. Baljeet comes inside carrying 2 X-rays.)
Baljeet: Look at this! (he shows a X-ray of a brain) This is my brain during the school year... (He then shows the other X-ray) And this is my brain now!
Isabella: They look just the same.
Baljeet: I know! But it took me three minutes to remember how to give my self a CAT scan! I am slipping!
Phineas: Not to worry, Baljeet. We've done a bit of cerebro-stimulatory haberdashery since you left.
Baljeet: Huh?
Buford: We made a hat for your brain, slowly. (at Isabella) Boy, he is slippin'.
Phineas: Try it on!
Baljeet: What does it do?
Phineas: Hold on. (Phineas then switch a control box) It stimulates your brain.
Baljeet: Oh my. 
(Switch to Candace in her room.)
Candace: (in her room) An electrical bike helmet? Lame! (she then lie down in bed then dials in her phone) Hey Stacy, you still wanna go to the pool? 
(Back in the backyard...)
Phineas: So Baljeet, how many sub-atomic particles do you suppose...are in that dandelion?
Baljeet: (goes over to the dandelion and picks it) Hmm... (drawing on the fence) Two point seven-three-two times ten to the twenty-sixth power of particles. But I could not tell you the exact location of any of them because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Phineas: Seems like it works.

Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus? You know, you could've waited till I put my pants on, that would've...least been polite. And do you know what we do to rude people around here? (presses remote, trapping Perry in a capsule) We put them in a water-soluble capsule. Ha ha! And there's not enough platypus spit in the world to get you out of it. Yeah, hop this way, let me show you what I've been up to.
(Perry follows Doofenshmirtz into a room filled with keys.)
Doofenshmirtz: Keys, keys, keys! Master keys, skeleton keys, latch keys, skate keys, I love keys! And you know, take it from me, (on the roof) once you've accidentally locked yourself in a milk can full of cockroaches for a couple of hours, you'll—you'll develop a real appreciation. But uh, collecting keys one at a time takes forever! That's why I've invented: THE KEY-FIND-INATOR! Or the Find-a-Key-inator! I -- I haven't quite figured out what I want to call it. Cool, huh? Soon, I will be able to open any door in the Tri-State Area, it's -- it's brilliant. Uh, but my key chain is enormous. And—and it weighs a ton and everyone can hear me coming. What I really need is one key that opens everything! The Key to the City! My pompous brother, the mayor, is always handing it out to some yokel of dubious qualifications. Well, today, it's going to be this yokel of dubious qualifications. 
(Back in the backyard)
Phineas: Wow, look at him go.
Isabella: He's like a new man!
Buford: Ah, he still gets de-pansed one leg at a time.
Baljeet: This is great! With my stimulated brain, I am dreaming up all sorts of super smart projects!
Phineas: Great!
Isabella: Picked out a favorite?
Baljeet: I have! You see, the greatest impediment to making astronomical observations, is our atmosphere. It is like looking through pea soup! So to make our terrestrial telescopes more effective, I am going to take all of the Earth s atmosphere, and put it on the moon! (shows poster that shows what he's saying)
Phineas: Uh...
Isabella: I don't...um...
Buford: Sounds... suffocatey.
Baljeet: Aw, I will disintegrate that bridge when I come to it.
Isabella: But Baljeet, if the atmosphere is gone --
Baljeet: And it is so simple! I can use an ion coupling device to attract each atmospheric molecule to the second greatest gravity source, which in this case, is the moon, and after the initial impact...
Isabella: (At the camera) He is so hard-core!
Baljeet: ...the particles will bounce up into lunar orbit! Blue skies on the moon! Imagine that!
(As he talks, Baljeet begins to build a universal transfer tower)
Phineas: Hey, Baljeet? Can I talk to you for a second?
Baljeet: Of course! I will just use small words!
Phineas: So...uh, we were hoping we could talk you out of transferring the Earth's atmosphere to the moon.
Baljeet: On the eve of my greatest triumph? (starts fidgeting)
Phineas: Well, we were just thinking it would be sort of a hollow victory, you know, with everybody not being able to breathe anymore?
Baljeet: (stops fidgeting) Science marches on!
Phineas: Okay, thanks! Brain booster, in retrospect...not such a good idea.
Buford: I think Brain Boy's had enough stimulation for one day. (tries to touch the control unit but gets shocked) Ow! Hey, that hurts!
Baljeet: Yes! Yes, it does! This way my work will not be interrupted by creatures who cannot possibly understand it! Like raccoons, or people, for instance.
Isabella: I was so looking forward to Junior High.
Phineas: We're going to have to get into that tower. Any ideas? 
(switches to D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, so the, uh, Key to the City ceremony's not starting for a while so, uh...we got some...Oh, you know, I-I just realized that I'm...I'm wearing a white lab coat and I'm leaning back against a black tire. That's... (sighs) I think I might have to go change. 
(In Baljeet's tower)
Phineas: (over monitor) Maybe we could each get a tool, and come at him from four different sides.
Isabella: (over monitor) Baljeet is way to smart to fall for a trick like that.
(continues under)
Baljeet: Plot all you want, I have my eye on you! No one will be able to stop me from stripping away the Earth's atmosphere! Oh, the things I will be able to see!
(Outside, decoys of Phineas, Isabella, Ferb and Buford are in place of the real kids with a tape recorder.)
Phineas recording: He was smart before, but now he's like a super genius!
Isabella recording: Maybe, we should try flattery to win him over.
Buford recording: Or, how 'bout a bribe?
Phineas recording: I don't think we could offer him anything that would satisfy his super intellect.
Isabella recording: Yeah, he's so amazingly smart, now.
(camera pans underground, revealing the real kids with jetpacks)
Phineas: All right, gang. This is our change to attack the Atmospheric Device.
Isabella: He's bound to notice that.
Phineas: Exactly!
Buford: This is just busy work, isn't it? 
(Phineas peeks out of a manhole on the street, then he and the gang blast out on their jetpacks. Baljeet's camera spots them.)
Baljeet: Jetpacks? I thought you were -- (picks up Isabella's decoy) Wood pulp effigies? Ha ha ha ha! Clever, but not clever enough!

(Baljeet manages to zap the kids, but they are obviously stuffed versions of themselves.)
Baljeet: Aww! I got you in my tractor beam! (starts pushing buttons) Time to strip the atmosphere from our planet, and allow an unobstructed view of the cosmos!
(the Atmospheric Device starts to static, causing dark clouds to cover the sun and the scene to go all foggy like. The same dark clouds begin to cover the earth) 
(Cut to Candace coming out the door in a swimsuit.)
Candace: Danville Pool, Here I...
(she stops in place as she sees the Atmospheric Device, then dials the phone.)
Candace: (sternly) Hello, Mom?
(cut to Linda at the bank, a man and woman behind her are sobbing)
Linda: Uh-huh? Uh-huh. That would count as dangerous. But I can't go anywhere until I find my keys. 
(The scene gets more dark as we shift to D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Wow! Great mad scientist weather, isn't it, Perry the Platypus? It's so dramatic! Ooh, the ceremony should be starting now.
(shift to Roger)
Roger: And now, it is my pleasure to present the Key to the city to this great humanitarian and American.
(applause)
Recipient: Th-thank you, thank you. Um, you know, when I set out to reinvent the ball-peen hammer -- (inator ray hits the key) HEY!

Doofenshmirtz: I've got it! I've got it! (at Perry) There, you see? I told you it was water solu -- (Perry's capsule melts and he punches him) OH! 
(The fog over the earth begins to swirl and rise toward the moon.)
Baljeet: Only a few more seconds to my greatest triumph! I wonder what I will do tomorrow.
Phineas: (over speaker) Attention, Baljeet! Prepare to surrender!
Baljeet: Ha ha ha ha! Surrender to whom? You are frozen!
Phineas: (over speaker) Are we?
(Scene zooms to the stuffed Phineas in the tractor beam)
Baljeet: That is not possible! Well, I mean, clearly, it is possible, but highly unlikely. Prepare to be --
Buford: SURPRISE! (pulls Baljeet's helmet off and sees his giant brain.) OH! OH! Oh, that is SO GROSS! But it's kinda awesome.
(Baljeet's brain deflates)
Baljeet: Something is different. (at Buford) How did you get in here?
Phineas: We tunneled up through the base while you were busy with our jetpack decoys.
Baljeet: I do not understand.
Phineas: Well, remember when we all made those life-sized stuffed models of ourselves this morning?
Baljeet: No.
Ferb: It pays to show up on time.
Baljeet: I will get an alarm clock.
Electronic voice: Two minutes to atmospheric transfer.
Baljeet: Oh! It is too late! I do not understand the controls anymore!
Isabella: Didn't you build a fail-safe or something?
Baljeet: YES! Of course! It is right here, and the key is right on that hook! (notices there isn't a key and gasps) 
(At D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Here it comes! Here it comes! (gets the key) Ha ha! I got it! At last, I, Heinz Doofenshmirtz, can open any door with this, the Key to the City—you know, I can't believe it's cartoonishly big. It's almost like it's not a real key, but just sort of, symbolic of a key. It's... (sees Perry) Hey, what are you doing?
(Perry sets the inator to "Returninate All Keys" and the inator begins to spit all the keys out. It self-destructs)
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, well, whatever, Perry the Platypus. (as Perry leaves) I got what I want! This giant, metal key that, when I think about it, is probably too big to fit into any of the keyholes that I would ever come across. Which makes me question the whole val -- (gets shocked by lightning) 
(At the bank)
Linda: Oh, I'll just call the -- (her keys land in her hand, followed by the man and woman behind her) Oh, for goodness sake! They were in my hand the whole time! 
(Back at the Atmospheric Device)
Electronic: Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four...
Baljeet: (overlapping, runs back and forth) AAAAAHHHHH! WHERE IS THE KEY?! WHERE IS IT?!
(a key lands on the key rack)
Isabella: Is this it?
Baljeet: Yes!!
Electronic voice: ...three, two, one.
(Baljeet inserts the key into a lock and turns it.)
Electronic voice: Atmospheric Transfer terminated.
Baljeet: (sighs) 
(The Earth's transfer fog retreats and disappears, returning the scene to a nice sunny day.)
Isabella: We should do something about that helmet, huh?
Buford: No! No, you should not! (he is wearing the helmet) I used my now vastly superior intellect to build the world's largest wedgie machine!
(Phineas, Ferb and Isabella take one step away from Baljeet.)
Baljeet: Boy, you try to eliminate the atmosphere one time... 
(Cut to Linda's car in the driveway, Candace runs up to her.)
Candace: Mom! Mom! Backyard! 
(Buford laughs loudly as Baljeet shudders and whimpers. Buford reaches toward Baljeet as if he was gonna wedgie him, but the wedgie machine grabs the Atmospheric Device and rockets into space with it, along with the helmet still connected to it, which is right on schedule for Linda and Candace to arrive in the backyard as Buford's brain deflates.) 
Candace: (With her eyes closed) Look!
Phineas: Hi, Mom!
Buford: Something is...different.
Candace: (opens her eyes) But there was a -- monstrous building here just a second ago!
Linda: Well, it pays to be on time. (at the kids) Who wants pie?
Phineas: I know I do!
Buford/Isabella/Baljeet: Oh, me!/Me, me, me!/Me, me, me!/Me!
(Perry enters the yard as Candace hangs her head in shame.)
Phineas: (offscreen) Oh, there you are, Perry.
(Perry chatters)
Candace: I'm going to get an alarm clock. 
(Scene opens with Phineas and Ferb in the backyard of the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Phineas: We'll combine the zipperoo with the terror drop, and move clown town after the Ferris wheel, and we end the whole ride with a house of mirrors bouncy castle. It's great! A citywide amusement park on a single track. And you only have to wait in line once!
Paul: Delivery!
Phineas: Hi Paul!
Paul: Hey boys, you ordered 20 tons of building material?
Phineas: We sure did!
Paul: Okay, sign here. Hmm, thought i had a pen here somewhere...
Phineas: No problem, I'll just use the pen you left here yesterday. (signs form) Ferb and I modified it so you won't lose it again.
Paul: Huh. What did you guys do, install a homing sensor?
Ferb: Actually, we just put a clip on it.
Paul: Cool! Haha, here's your form. 
(Switches to Paul driving in his truck)
Paul: Hi, dad. Yes, I just delivered to Phineas and Ferb. Yes. Yes, they are. No, I left them the blue copy.
Paul's Dad: No, son. You always have to leave them the pink copy. The blue copy's yours. You gotta take your job more seriously. Now you're running seven seconds behind!
Paul: Dad, I'm not sure if I really wanna be a delivery guy.
Paul's Dad: Of course you wanna be a delivery guy. You just don't wanna be a delivery guy who's seven seconds behind. Step it up!
Paul: Alright, Dad. Talk to you later, bye. (hangs up phone; turns on radio)
Radio DJ: Hey hey, listeners, the WJOP's party van is out there somewhere in the Tri-State Area. The first lucky listener who spot the party van and say the Phrase that Pays, wins a special prize!
Paul: (radio off) Ooh, here's my next delivery.

Paul: What a weird looking building. (goes into Evil Incorporated to find that the elevator has broken down) Out of order? Great! (struggles up the many flights of stairs) (knocks)
Doofenshmirtz: (from inside) It's open~.
Paul: (goes in with the package) Helloo. Delivery. (a cage falls from above, trapping him in a platypus-sized cage)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, you're not Perry the Platyp- Oh, sorry about that. (retracts the trap) I was expecting someone else.
Paul: No problem. Happens to me all the time.
Doofenshmirtz: Really? (signs the form)
Paul: I'm just kidding.
Doofenshmirtz: Aaa-ah. Hey nice clip.
Paul: Thanks. Hey, I like your place. What do you do here?
Doofenshmirtz: Well, you know, different things, but today I'm building a Juice-inator (shows Paul the Inator) It's going to turn City Hall into juice!
Paul: Oho, is it now?
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, then I'm gonna take over the Tri-State Area! You know, like you too.
Paul: Well, at least you got a plan. I haven't figured out what I'm wanna do with my life.
Doofenshmirtz: Don't sell yourself short, perhaps you can be one of my minions! Not an indoor minion, but a minion that keep the coalfires burning.
Paul: Yeah, I'm not sure that's a step up. Here you go (hands blue copy then leaves)
Doofenshmirtz: You should think about that offer! Miniony! It's a growth industry. (looks at the blue copy in his hand) Oh, he forgot to leave me the pink copy. 
Paul: (as he gets inside his truck) Juice City Hall, what a character.

Phineas: Hi Paul. (Paul waves at him)
Paul: That's what they did with the building material!
Radio DJ: We're still looking for that first listener to spot WJOP's party van, and say the Phrase that Pays--

Paul: (getting off his truck to see the van) Hey, you're the WJOP party van!
Radio DJ/Party Van Driver: Hey, you're the first listener to spot us!
Paul: Wow! If only I knew the phrase that pays.
Radio DJ: (taps his bell) That's it baby. The phrase that pays is The Phrase That Pays! You win the grand prize!

Candace: Phineas and Ferb! With technology that's slightly more advanced than what we have today. Mom! (She runs off.)
Baljeet: You are doing it again!
Buford: It helps my arches!
Phineas: Look guys! It's Regent Monogram, and that girl must be... Princess Isabella! 
Princess Isabella: Regent Monogram? When can I meet some of the local children?
Regent Monogram: Princess, I'm afraid it's just not safe for you out in the wide world what with Doofus Khan on the loose.
Princess Isabella: Doofus Khan! He has been a plague on our land for far too long!
Regent Monogram: I promise once his forces have been defeated we'll throw you the biggest party money can buy. Of course it won't cost you anything because you're a hereditary monarch. 
Candace: Mom, wait till you see what Phineas and Ferb and their friends have done now!
Candace and Lawrence: Look!
Lawrence: Acrobats!
Linda: Acrobats? I love acrobats.
Candace: No, Mom, over...
(The acrobats shed their uniforms to reveal they are warriors.)
Lawrence: (gasps) Oh no, Doofus Khan's warriors!
(The acrobats attack and the crowd flees)
Buford: He's going after the royal... thingy!
Baljeet: It is called a jiao. 
(A warrior snatches Princess Isabella while she screams in fear)
Regent Monogram: See this is exactly what I was... The Princess!! 
Phineas: Buford, get us down there! Quick!
(Buford lowers the plank) 
Regent Monogram: The Princess! The Princess! Doofus Khan why that impertinent... (Gets hit by a taunting scroll) A taunting scroll? How uncouth!
General Carl: Should I order the final attack, sir?
Regent Monogram: No, no, General Carl. A full-scale attack now would put the Princess at risk. Oh, if only Master Perry had not given up the way of the warrior and gone to live a contemplative life on the Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness, he could retrieve the Princess. Oh, if only someone could reach him and tell him of our plight! 
Phineas: Hey guys, We know what we're gonna do today! 
♪ Doofus Khan's multi-level yurt! ♪
Princess Isabella: Doofus Khan, (budges free from the grip of two warriors) Regent Monogram will have your head!
Doofus Khan: Regent Monogram will never attack as long as I have his Princess. Which should buy me all the time I need to complete my secret weapon and take over the Ten-Province area!? Meanwhile, I'm putting you in the penthouse dungeon. You'll love the view. Of course I've planted booby traps all along the way and I alone know how to avoid them. (He gets hit by a giant shoe) Heh. Must have forgot that one. (A step opens up and he notices a hammer) Oops! (The hammer shoots a laser at him) Oh, that's right. (The step opens again) You're supposed to skip this step. (He screams as he falls into a step. He gets burnt, and gets chomped on by piranhas) Everything's under control, but-- (The step opens once again and gets hit by a boxing glove) Testing the system-- (Various booby traps are activated as the camera pans to the top of the stairs) Hey, hey, it works. (Gets caught by a bear trap) Anyway, here you are. (Takes out a set of keys and tries the keys to open the door) You'll have a nice rack to sleep on and some rats to keep you company. (Opens the door) So while your here, enjoy your stay. Ta-ta Princess! (Slaps the door) I'll see you-- (Stairs turn into a chute) 
Phineas: There it is, The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness.
Buford: Ya know what I hate about The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness? Just to get there you have to cross the Uncrossable River of Uncrossableness.
Baljeet: Who named all these things?
Buford: That guy over there, The Redundant Scribe of Redundantness.
The Redundant Scribe of Redundantness: Hi there! Greetings!
Phineas: Okay. (The Redundant Scribe of Redundantness continues talking in the background) Ferb do we have anything for uncrossable rivers? (Ferb pulls out a grappling hook that looks like a crossbow)
Candace: What are they up to now?
(Ferb shoots the grappling hook across the river and attaches a carriage)
Buford: Oh, that'll do. (He and Baljeet get on the carriage)
Candace: (Growls)
Baljeet: Look, a Chinese eviscerating fish. Though I suppose here in China we just call them eviscerating fish.
(Candace starts swinging across the rope)
Candace: (Mocking Baljeet) Oh but here we just call them evilscerating... (Candace screams and falls into the river)
Buford: So how do we get up The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness?
Phineas: No worries, Buford. (Baljeet takes his hiking stick and leafs through his backpack) I think we have just the thing. (Pulls out a block of wood)
Candace: (While wringing her hair) Oh, come on!
(They are climbing up on a jiao with gigantic mechanical feet, emerging from red clouds)
Candace: (While climbing up the side of the mountain) Stupid Mountain of Stupidness!
(Redundant Scribe of Redundantness pops out of mountain)
Redundant Scribe of Redundantness: Actually, that was my original name for it! (Candace falls off the mountain into red clouds) Oops, my bad, sorry, my apologizes, mea culpa!
(Master Perry is seen flying a kite)
Phineas: Master Perry, (He and Ferb get out. Master Perry puts down the kite) This is a great honor. (He and Ferb bow)
Buford: Wow. I can't believe he's a platypus.
Baljeet: Phineas pulled a jiao with giant mechanical feet out of his backpack and that is what bugs you?
Phineas: Master Perry! Doofus Khan has kidnapped the Princess and only you can save her!
(Master Perry chatters in disagreement)
Phineas: You mean you won't? But why, Master Perry? What made you give up the life of a warrior hero?
(Master Perry begins to ripple)
Phineas: What's he doing?
Ferb: That's a ripple dissolve. He must be having a flashback.
Phineas: Does he know we can't see it? Should we give him some privacy? I don't know the protocol for flashbacks.
(Perry stops rippling)
Phineas: Is he back? He's back. Well judging by the time you spent staring off into space I'm guessing something pretty bad. But someone has to rescue the Princess, if you won't come with us at least you can train us to do it ourselves!

(Perry starts rippling again)
Buford: He's doing it again.
Buford, Phineas, and Baljeet: Goodbye, Perry.
(Master Perry continues flying his kite. Candace reaches Perry)
Candace: (Panting) Where are they?
(Perry starts rippling)
Candace: You know I can't see anything right?
(Shows Phineas and the others in a jiao on a pogo stick)
Phineas: Follow my lead when we get there; we're going right in the front door. 
(They crash into Doofus Khan's headquarters)
Buford: I knew we shouldn't have let Baljeet drive.
Phineas: Never mind that, you two stay here and fend off the guards, Ferb and I will rescue the princess.
Buford: We got it covered, just watch out for booby traps.
(Various booby traps activate and Phineas and Ferb get to the top of the staircase unscathed)
Phineas: We made it and completely unscathed. Good thing we brought along that yak bladder. Princess Isabella, we've come to rescue you stand away from the...
(Isabella flings the door open and hugs Phineas)
Princess Isabella: My hero!
Phineas: Don't worry Princess, we'll take the banister down. It's safer.
(Phineas, Ferb and Princess Isabella slide down the banister to find Baljeet and Buford surrounded by knocked out guards)
Phineas: Holy mackerel! how did you guys defeat all these soldiers?
Random soldier: We're okay.
Buford: There was nothing to it.
(Buford starts rippling)
Phineas: There's no time for flashbacks! We have to go!
Buford: What flashback? (They all run off) I'm just rippling! It relaxes me.
(Camera pans to Doofus Khan watching them escape)
Doofus Khan: Well would you look at that a bunch of kids running away with the Princess... Running away with the Princess?!?! (Slides down a fireman pole) Oh, time to take matters into my own hands!
(Doofus Khan jumps into a giant robotic dragon, which flies toward the castle, turns it on and flies off, laughing maniacally) 
Buford: What the heck is that?
Princess Isabella: It must be Doofus Khan's secret weapon. It's heading for the castle! What do we do?
Phineas: I've got an idea! 
(Dragon flies over Regent Monogram and General Carl's heads)
Regent Monogram: Great googly moogly!
Doofus Khan: (Laughs) Amazing what you can do with a little bamboo and rice paper huh?
Regent Monogram: Doofus Khan! What have you done with Princess Isabella?
Doofus Khan: That's none of your business, but there's no way she escaped forcing me to move up my plans I can tell you that!
Regent Monogram: You barbarian!
Doofus Khan: I know I am but what are you. (Dragon sticks out tongue) Hehe. You like that? The tongue set me back a week but it was totally worth it.
Regent Monogram: Carl, duck!
General Carl: No, actually sir I think it's a draw... (Carl gets slapped by the dragon's tail) Oh, that kind of duck.
(Doofus Khan starts using his robot to burn the castle)
Doofus Khan: (Laughs) Time for a little remodeling!
General Carl: We can't take much more of this! What do we do?
Doofus Khan: Surrender! Oh what now? (A giant terracotta warrior starts marching towards them) A giant terracotta warrior? Roughly the same size as my dragon? 
(Shows Phineas and the others inside the terracotta warrior)
Phineas: Left leg! Right Leg! 
Doofus Khan: What could he possibly want? (Terracotta warrior goes to "crane" position) Oh he's doing that crane thing. (Terracotta warrior kicks the dragon in the face) You know, 4 centuries from now that move is gonna be real cliché. (Dragon breathes fire on the terracotta warrior) Of course, being terracotta you would be fire-proof. Okay, mono to mono (The robots fight) Ow that's not your mono!
Regent Monogram: Man, they would love this in Japan! 
Candace: What the? Phineas and Ferb, Doofus Khan and their friends too!!!! Mom! 
(Terracotta warrior slaps dragon repeatedly)
Doofus Khan: Agh, slapies! I hate slapies! (Terracotta warrior pushes the dragon away, then the dragon tail taps on the warriors soldier and when the soldier turns around, the dragon takes a wind up key out of the warrior's back)
Doofus Khan: (Laughs) Gotcha!
(Terracotta warrior deactivates)
Baljeet: He has the key to our defeat!
Buford: You make puns when the other guy is down, dumbbell!
Doofus Khan: Aww, poor babies feeling tired, huh? Allow me to put you to sleep! (Dragon picks up a building)
Princess Isabella: (Everyone gasps) Ew, who puts armpit hair on a mechanical dragon?
Doofus Khan: Next time, don't put your wind up key in such an obvious place. I cleverly hid mine in a spot only an ancient warrior would dare to go. (It shows Perry coming down from the sky) No, Perry the Platypus! (Perry hits the dragon's nose) Hey, careful with the soft palette there! (Perry jumps into the dragon's mouth and rolls up the tongue revealing a wind up key. He chatters)
Phineas: Ferb, the key! (Ferb shoots a grappling hook grabbing the key out of the dragon's mouth. Causing the dragon to deactivate and drop the building on itself) Uh-Oh! Eject everybody!
(Phineas and the others jump out of the warrior as it and the dragon fall, over falling apart, just as Candace brings Linda over.) 
Candace: (With her eyes closed) Eee-eee-eee-eee... Look!
Linda: A giant mechanical terracotta warrior? (Walking away) Really, Candace? Wouldn't that be slightly more advanced that what we have today?
Candace: Well, that would've been the point! 
(Regent Monogram and Princess Isabella run to each other, embracing.)
Princess Isabella: Regent Monogram!
Regent Monogram: Princess!
Princess Isabella: Party now?
Regent Monogram: You betcha!
Princess Isabella: Great!
Doofus Khan: Ah, well, back to the drawing board. (General Carl puts him in a Chinese finger trap)
General Carl: Compliments of Regent Monogram.
Doofus Khan: Oh, I hate these things! (A taunting scroll hits him) Insult to injury.
Regent Monogram: Well all's well that ends well. Maybe someday we will find a way to keep our fair lands safe from barbarian invaders.
Princess Isabella: You know, I think these blocks would make a great wall.
Phineas: Ferb, I know what were going to do tomorrow! 
(Many, many years later, at the Great Wall of China...)
Elderly Phineas: Well, that took longer than expected.
Elderly Ferb: But, it is a great wall.
Elderly Phineas: Yeah. So, what you wanna do tomorrow? (Ferb glares at him and then leaves) What? I kid. We can rest, how about a game of mahjong? 
(Scene opens up showing Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella in front of an Exotic Smoothies truck.)
Vendor: That's one exotic dragon-fruit smoothie for you, (at Baljeet) and one for you!
Phineas: I'm just saying as a non-sequitur, a talking zebra just seems a little.
Isabella: Forced?
Phineas: Yeah! Forced.
Baljeet: Mmm! The sweet taste of an unusual and exotic smoothie!
Buford: You know, this smoothie isn't really unusual or exotic. It's about as exotic as a stay-cation with Aunt Meryl!
Baljeet: But, Buford, your postcard said that she had a pool.
Buford: She has a patio.
Isabella: Tomorrow, we should work on Buford's penmanship.
Baljeet: Actually, most would consider dragon-fruit to be that exotic, indeed. (Buford starts to imitate Baljeet) Known for its dazzling flowers, it is actually the fruit of several... (Sees Buford mocking him) What are you doing? Stop. Stop that. Stop. Stop it. Stop. (Baljeet starts drinking his smoothie, and Buford mocks him as well) Stop that.
Isabella: You know, Buford's kind of right. These smoothies are sort of exotic, but I think we can do better. What do you think, Phineas?
Phineas: What do I think? (Ferb tries to talk, but is halted by Phineas) Don't answer that. Guys, I know what we're going to do today! I wonder what kind of smoothie Perry would like? 
(Cuts to the backyard. Perry puts on his fedora and his helmet. He then pulls a tricycle out of the bushes, and begins to ride it. He rings the bells and then goes to an underground tunnel, and through the parking garage. He then goes to the elevator that leads him to his lair. He parks his tricycle by chaining it to the bike racks)
Major Monogram: Come in. Sit down, Agent P. We have a serious problem. It seems that someone, and I'm not saying who, someone has spilled on the couch in the lobby.
Carl: Sir, I..
Major Monogram: A very expensive couch when we bought it in 1985.
Carl: Sir, all I did was turn the cushion over. The stain was already...
Major Monogram: If the responsible party is present...
Carl: Sir, it was Agent M. He spilled a latte in 1990.
Major Monogram: Ugh. We were hoping to get him here a couple of years out of that couch...
Carl: Anywho?
Major Monogram: Anywho, our surveillance operatives have been getting some mixed signals from Doofenshmirtz. He was observed at the Danville Library, checking out books on Eastern Australia and hydrostatic cell fusion. We haven't come up with any ideas about what he's up to...
Carl: Maybe he's trying to recreate Pangaea, sir
Major Monogram: Like I said, we haven't come up with anything yet. So, we need you to get in there, and find out. Good luck, and be careful out there 
(Cuts to the backyard with Isabella, Phineas, and Ferb with something covered)
Phineas: Okay, everyone! Ferb and I developed a device that can literally turn any solid into liquid, so we can enjoy all sorts of new and unusual flavors. Isabella?
Isabella: Abracapocus!
(Takes off the blanket and reveals nothing)
Phineas: Wow! That was really impressive!
Isabella: I just got my magic patch. Let's try this again.
(Unveils the device)
Phineas: Behold! The state of the matter transfer device! All right, Buford, is that chicken ready?
Buford: All set.
(Ferb zaps the chicken to a liquid state)
Isabella: I got ya! There you are. Liquid poultry.
Buford: (drinks it) Mmm. Tastes like chicken.
Phineas: I think we need to try something a little more.
Ferb: Foul?
Phineas: Yeah! No! Exotic!

(Perry falls into Doofenshmirtz's traps)
Doofenshmirtz: Well, hello, Perry the Platypus! Over here. No, here. Look a-- Look a little more this way. (Poorly imitates Perry's chatter) What do you think? Huh? I've joined you in the genus Ornithorhynchus. That's right, I am a platypus! (Evil laughter) Yeah, hang on. Let me turn off the dramatic lighting. How did this come to be? I'll tell you, since you didn't ask. After years of being bested by your battles, I decided to fight fire with fire, and in both cases, fire means platypus, and with just means with. It was simple; the best way to beat a platypus was to become a platypus. That way, our skills would be evenly matched. So, after a couple of hours of promising experiments and some intricate designs, I finally created the Platyp-inator! Pretty cool, huh? Now, before I defeat you, I think I should further level the playing field. There, now I'm trapped, too. And go! You're not struggling, I said go. We should both be-- (Perry joins in) Yeah, like that. Okay. 
(Cut to the backyard)
Phineas: Isabella, you wanna go next?
Isabella: Why, yes. How about a romantic dinner for two? (Ferb zaps the romantic dinner ) Wanna sip, Phineas?
Phineas: Oh, no, thanks.
Isabella: Oh, okay. I understand. You know, you want to keep yourself open to other drink options. I get it.
Phineas: Actually, I didn't want to say anything in front of anybody, but, it's, I don't like zucchini.
Isabella: Oh.

Candace: And that is why we wear white shoes after Labor Day. And I.. (Sees Phineas and Ferb's invention) Oh, I knew it. Phineas and Ferb. Not very impressive, but suspicious. Stacy, I.. I got to go. Oh, and Happy Birthday! Mom! Mom! Mom!

Linda: Oh, laundry. Sometimes, I feel like our first president, because I'm washing a ton. (laughs) Ah, yeah.
Candace: Mom! Mom! Mom! You have to come out to the backyard!

Buford: I don't know, I kinda like her like that. She looks like Cand-berry sauce.

Phineas: Anyone else see that?
Doofenshmirtz: Wonder what that hit. Whatever that is, there's two of them now. Soon there's gonna be two of me, and then nothing can defeat me! Except maybe a bigger platypus made out of metal. Yeah, like that. (grunts) Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Even though I'm also a platypus at this point, and, uh... I hope this wears off soon. The novelty has worn thin.

In the old days, men would go into these things and pretend to be locked inside and then they would "escape" to the amazement of the crowd. Here, let me show you. (goes inside the chamber) You see? All you need to do is just... (tries to escape) Uh.... Hmm...
Phineas: You need a little help, Dad?
Lawrence: Well, no, no, I just need to, um... Oh! (Ferb helps him out) There we go. Thanks, son.

Candace: (mumbling in sleep) Where's Perry? 
(Back inside the house; Perry walks into the boys' room, goes into agent mode, holds onto a red hoop, and puts on his fedora. He then takes an orange-and-yellow box and performs a quick magic trick with it.)

Isabella: Wow, he's really selling it hard.
Baljeet: But if you designed the tower, will you not know every way to get out?
Phineas: (taps tower with cane) We programmed it to learn as it goes, so it's conceivable we could be trapped in there forever. (taps tower with cane again) Coming with?
Isabella: Yes! I mean, no./Baljeet: No!
Isabella/Baljeet: No.
Buford: It sounds ill-advised.
Phineas: That's okay. You guys can stay out here and be the cheering section with Candace.
(Camera pans to Candace)
Candace: (snoring) Must bust Phineas and Ferb.
Baljeet: But what if you do not come out?
Phineas: If we're not out in 15 minutes, you can smash the machine and rescue us, just like in the old days.
Buford: (brings out mallet) Sounds like a party.
Phineas: Ferb? Start the timer please!
(Ferb flips a switch; timer on the tower activates)
Buford: Synchronizing watches!
Phineas: (he and Ferb walks onto an elevator) Women and children and the faint of heart may wish (pushes button with cane) to leave now. (as the elevator rises up) So we bid you adieu! Goodbye! Auf wiedersehen! Farewell, friends!
(The elevator lowers him and Ferb into the tower.)
Phineas: And we'll see you in a few minutes! Or not at all!
(The now empty elevator rises up again, the door closes, which activated the locks.)
(timer beeping)
Baljeet: Legally speaking, what is our liability here? 
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.! ♪ 
(Scene starts with Perry next to a mat and a sign which reads "Please... Wipe Feet!" There's a pause then he does just that. Just then, a trap door activates and he falls into it. The trap door rises a second later and Perry's now trapped in a cat suit. Doofenshmirtz then leaps out and hooks a leash onto the collar.)
Doofenshmirtz: A-ha! I wanted to say something clever about "cat got your tongue", but I haven't worked it out. You see, when we were small children, my brother Roger was always better at the whole manners and etiquette thing.
(Flashback)
Young Roger: Sweet Aunt Effie, you have always been my favorite!
Aunt Effie: (pinching young Roger's cheek) Roger, so polite. (hands young Roger a coin) Heinz?
Young Doofenshmirtz: That's some mole!
(End flashback)
Doofenshmirtz: (sighs) It takes a long time to clean out a chicken coop with a spoon. And I still don't see how that was rude. I mean, that thing was gargantuan. If anything, I was showing restraint. Anyway, today, it is International Good Manners Day, and we've got a visiting dignitary. She's the ambassador from England! Only the most etiquetty country in the whole world, hello! And when Roger's introducing her I'm going to zap him with my Rude-inator!
(Camera pans to the Rude-inator then back to Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: That's what I'm calling it.
(Perry gives an unimpressed look)
Doofenshmirtz: It makes whoever it zaps intolerably rude! He'll cause an international incident! And in all the confusion, I'll just waltz in and take over. So, why the catsuit? Well, we're going to be at City Hall to watch the fireworks, you and me, and I figured a platypus in a fedora might attract too much attention! Smart, huh? (walks away with a smug look) See, me, always thinking. 
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb, now inside the tower.)
Phineas: Good day to you, Tower. We're ready to begin.
Tower: Welcome, boys. We're gonna have so much fun together. (puts strait-jackets on the boys) Put on your coats and stay a while.
Phineas: Strait-jackets. Classic. Ready?
(He stands on his head. Ferb then grabs hold of Phineas's strait-jacket with his teeth.)
Phineas: Okay, shake me out.
(Ferb does so; Phineas escapes from his strait-jacket.)
Phineas: Awesome!
(Phineas then quickly undoes the buckle off of Ferb's.)
Phineas: (after Ferb shakes his strait-jacket off) This is gonna be fun.
(The tower puts the boys in chains then pulls them up to a dungeon.)
Phineas: I don't know, Ferb, I think we should "file" (pulls out a file) this under Dungeon Escape.
(The boys escapes from the chains off-screen then walks towards a grate. Phineas removes it and he and Ferb goes into the next room.) 
(Cut to the City Hall.)
Doofenshmirtz: Well, here we are! (chuckles) Right up close! You sit here, Perry the Catypus. (laughs) I just came up with that. That totally makes up for missing the "cat got your tongue" thing from before.
Roger: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to City Hall on this fine first day of National Etiquette Week.
(Audience applauds; camera then pans to Perry.)
Woman: I do love proper etiquette! 
(Inside the tower, the camera shows a room with doors of various sizes and some keys lying on the floor. The largest of the doors opens and Phineas and Ferb enters the room.)
Phineas: Hmm. Big keys, tiny doors. We're not fitting through any of those, but maybe that one!
(Camera pans up to the exit then down to the boys. Ferb grabs some of the keys and uses them to make a stair.)
Phineas: Ferb, you're a genius!
(Ferb finishes placing keys in the keyholes then he and Phineas escapes the room.)
Tower: Nice warm up, boys.
(The boys are now climbing up a metal ladder.)
Tower: But can you escape the relentless pull of gravity?
(The tower flips the trap upside down and the boys looses their grip then falls down.)
Phineas: (screaming) It's the Bottomless Pit Trap. (he and Ferb high fives) 
(Outside in the backyard, the timer first shows 11:27, then 11:26, and finally 11:25. The camera then pans to Baljeet, who's placing a pyramid of playing cards on the sleeping Candace.)
Baljeet: It would be terrible if they did not come out!
Isabella: I know! (squirts some shaving cream on Candace's head)
(Camera pans to Buford, sharping his mallet on an old-fashioned grindstone.)
Buford: I'm countin' on it. 
(City Hall; Roger's continuing with his speech.)
Roger: And to speak further on this topic, it is my great pleasure to introduce the Ambassador from England, the most etiquetty country in the world...
Doofenshmirtz: Told you!
Roger: ... and my personal friend,
(Doofenshmirtz presses a button on a controller) 
(Cut to D.E.I., where a ray from the Rude-inator fires) 
(Back at City Hall)
Roger: ...this unbelievable windbag right here.
(Camera pans to a grinning Doofenshmirtz then to a shocked looking ambassador)
(man coughing)
Roger: Oh, man! On and on and on in the limo over here. (mimicking ambassador) "Manners are so important."
Doofenshmirtz: Can you believe this, Perry the...
(Camera pans to show that Perry had escaped the catsuit trap)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, for Pete's sake, Perry the Platypus. I told you to go before we left. (at himself) He better bring back some popcorn, that's all I can say.
Roger: ...what a pompous know-it-all you are.
Woman: That's it! I want a recall.
All: Recall! Recall! Recall!
Doofenshmirtz: (grinning) It's working! 
(In the Bottomless Pit Trap, Phineas finally gets an idea)
Phineas: Wait! I've got it. Give me your hands.
(He and Ferb clasp hands then slows down to a halt. Mostly as Phineas notices the exit out of the trap.)
Phineas: Come on, Tower!
(He kicks the door open with a foot)
Phineas: Is that the best you can can throw at us?
Tower: (rudely) Ooh, so special. I don't give a flying buttress.
(The boys are now crawling in a narrow tunnel)
Phineas: Tower, are you feeling okay?
Tower: Oh, what's it to you?
Phineas: Oh, nothing, nothing.
(Camera shifts to the interior of a sawmill. Phineas opens a door from the inside of a hollow log.)
Phineas: I thought we programmed you to be more polite than this.
(He stands on the log then helps Ferb up onto it.)
Tower: You think you're so sharp, don't you?
(Ferb closes the door; the tower then ties him and Phineas onto the log.)
Tower: I'm gonna show you something sharper.
(Just as the tower said that, a saw activates and it cuts through a log.)
Phineas: I think there may be something wrong with the Tower. I'm taking suggestions here.
(Ferb kicks off his shoes then uses his feet to untie himself. He does the same thing to release Phineas.)
Phineas: Okay, dude, don't show off.
(The boys jump off the log just before the saw cuts it in half.)

(Backyard; the timer first shows 00:25, and then 00:24. Baljeet's now about to put one of Candace's hands into a bowl of water.)
Baljeet: Oh, my gosh! It is almost time.
Isabella: (placing objects between Candace's toes) What if they can't get out?
Buford: (drawing an eye on the sticky note) How come you guys didn't tell me about this before?
Candace: Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.
(Just then, Phineas and Ferb finally escaped the tower by tunneling themselves out of it.)
Phineas: Made it. Boy! That was close.
(cheering)
(The timer shows that Phineas and Ferb escaped the tower with 17 seconds remaining.)
Baljeet: Was it scary?
Isabella: Was it hard?
Buford: Do I still get to smash the tower?
Tower: I ain't done with you yet. (activates a force field around its lower half)
Buford: Wow! I thought I had a bad attitude. 
(Cuts to D.E.I. where Perry exits out of a cab. Minutes later, he enters Doofenshmirtz's apartment, runs towards the Rude-inator, and plugs up the ray with a cork. He then makes a dramatic leap off of the -inator and leaves the building on his hang-glider.) 
(City Hall; Roger is continuing his tirade, much to Doofenshmirtz's amusement.)
Audience: Recall! Recall!
Roger: ...and so's your sister!
Doofenshmirtz: Wow! Such rudeness. This is working better than I ever imagined.
Roger: Miss High-and-Mighty English Manners Person, I have got one thing to say to you. And only one thing. That's some...
(He and the ambassador starts laughing)
Roger: ...show we just put on, isn't it, Madam Mayor?
Doofenshmirtz: What the...
Ambassador: You see, your wonderful Mayor and I agreed in the limousine to put on this little play for your edification.
(audience applauds)
Doofenshmirtz: (pushing button on remote repeatedly) No, no, no, no. 
(At D.E.I., the Rude-inator explodes due to the plug) 
(City Hall; the ambassador's speech continues)
Ambassador: Indeed, what would we be without manners?
Audience: Four more years. Four more years.
Doofenshmirtz: (pause) Curse you, Perry the Platypus. I didn't even get my popcorn. (realizes) Wait. If they were faking it, what did my ray hit? 
(Backyard; Phineas and Ferb are trapped inside a dome.)
Tower: Ooh, it looks like you two losers are still trapped. Might as well change your address, 'cause you're gonna be receiving your pension in here. Oopsie, activated my vacuum circuits. You dummies don't need air, do you? (blows raspberry)
Phineas: I'm feeling such an odd mixture of pride and mortal terror.
Buford: Don't worry, I'll get you out in just a sec.
(Isabella and Baljeet back away then Buford bangs the mallet on the dome... with no success.)
Buford: You guys are on your own.
Phineas: Well, thanks for trying I guess.
Buford: No problem. What are friends for?
Tower: Friends? I have been programmed to trap you and your friends.
Phineas: Oh, yeah!
(The tower raises the dome then lowers it around Phineas, Ferb, and their friends.)
Baljeet: Do me a favor. Next time you wanna make a fiendishly clever computer-controlled contraption, call one of your other friends.
Phineas: Hey! That's it. (at the tower) Tower. You were programmed to trap Ferb and me and our friends. But we've got friends all over Danville.
Tower: Is that so?
(The tower raises the dome then lowers it around Danville. Camera then pans to a smug Phineas.)
Phineas: In fact, we have friends all over the Tri-State Area.
Tower: Well, aren't we popular?
(The tower raises the dome then lowers it around the Tri-State Area.)
Ferb: Plus there was that small matter of circumnavigating the globe.
Phineas: You're right. Tokyo, Paris, Nepal. We have friends all over the Earth.
Tower: Look at me, I have got friends all over the Earth. All right then.
(The tower covers the Earth with the dome.)
Phineas: In fact, we even have an alien friend named Meap.
(Ferb holds up a picture of Meap)
Phineas: He is from another planet. So, really, we have friends all over the galaxy.
Tower: A small matter for one such as me.
(The tower leaves the backyard; the camera then pans to the Milky Way Galaxy)
Tower: You will never escape. Never!
(The tower covers the entire galaxy with the dome. Back in the backyard, Baljeet, Isabella, and Buford walks away.)
Baljeet: That works for me.
Buford: Well, they only make mallets so big.
Isabella: See ya.
Phineas: So, the entire galaxy. (grins) That enough elbow room for ya?
Ferb: Well, for today. 
(Meanwhile, alien spaceships finally get to the Milky Way...)
Alien: At last, after two millennia, we finally reached the Milky Way Galaxy. Battle stations! We begin our assault in three, two... Oh!
(All of the space ships hit the dome.)
Alien: Uh, anybody got a mallet? 
(Scene opens up zooming in on Major Monogram's house and then showing the master bedroom)
Carl: Well, how are we doing today, Major? Feeling better?
Major Monogram: Carl? What are you doing here?
Carl: Your wife said it'd be okay if I came up here and kept you company. Would that be all right? I brought a book!
Major Monogram: What kind of book?
Carl: (Somewhat excitedly) It's a fantasy adventure with wizards and knights!
Major Monogram: Are there woodland sprites?
Carl: Well, there's water sprites.
Major Monogram: (After a short pause) Go ahead.
Carl: (Begins reading) Devote your mind to this tale of the distant past, and the adventures that did befall the most noble of knights. (Scene ripples into a scene of a medieval cottage) Where stood the cottage of the humble antique dealer... 
Laurence: Cheerio, dear! I'm off to hide these common objects for a couple'a hundred years, until they become valuable.
Linderella: Don't forget to put hay in the ox! (goes inside and begins to do chores) Candavere! I need you to fetch me some more water! Candavere! Oh, where is that maid? 
(Scene changes, showing Candavere's room, where she is writing a letter and reading it aloud)
Candavere: Stachilda, news have I upon this evening. At the harvest bonfire I shall be on the arm of Jeremiad. Signed, Candavere. (Finishes writing) There! And now to send off this missive. (Ties letter to pigeon's foot) The time has come to do your duty, my stout-winged messenger! (Releases pigeon out the window, and it flies off, and is burnt up as a column of fire shoots out of the alchemy stove) 
(Scene shows Phineas and Ferbalot's alchemy set in the yard. Parable is being used to light the stove. Ferb picks up beaker)
Phineas: That should catalyze it. We'll add it to our inventory of magical elixirs. What say we try a couple of these out? (They both take a potion and Ferbalot pours his on himself, turning into a cyclops) Cool, a cyclops! My turn! (Pours his potion on himself) A manticore! With a lion's head. (Ferbalot takes another potion) A cockatrice!
(Candavere comes through the cottage door)
Candavere: (Singing) Oh yeah, getting some water, and (Slams into door) Yack! ...Gonna have a great Midsummer Woad-Gathering Harvest Bonfire's Eve. (Sees Phineas) Good morrow, Phineas! (Begins singing again) ...With Jeremiad. (sees Ferbalot) Good morrow, Ferbalot! (Realizes what the boys are up to) Grr! What flaxen homespun have we swaggering here?!
Phineas: Careful, Candavere. Better not look at Ferbalot, or you'll turn to stone. (Ferbalot has turned into a Gorgon)
Candavere: This is a most inopportune time for your infernal hijinks, and for once our sad sweet mother will be heralded to your inpropri- Argh, I can't talk like this anymore! You guys are so busted! Mom! (running into the house, she slams into the door again) Yack! (goes into house and slams door)
Phineas: I don't know about you, Ferbalot, but I didn't get any of that. (They both pour a potion on themselves and return to normal; it begins to rain) Hey, there's something fishy about this rain. It's...it's unearthly. Come on, we better get inside.
Lady of the Puddle: (Bursts out of a puddle) Behold! I am the Lady of the Puddle!
Phineas: Don't you mean the Lady of the Lake?
Lady of the Puddle: No, that's my mom.
(Camera pans to the Lady of the Lake)
Lady of the Lake: Hey, kids! You're getting a little quest of your own. Oh, that's so nice.
(Camera pans back to the kids)
Lady of the Puddle: Anyway...Ferbalot, you and Phineas must find the legendary sword Excaliferb and use it to stop the evil sorcerer Malifishmirtz, who is behind this unearthly rain.
Phineas: Yeah, Ferb and I were just talking about the rain. Unearthly—that's...isn't that the word I used? Yeah, I used—I just--
Lady of the Puddle: I will send the magical water sprite, Isabel, to guide you on your quest.
Phineas: Great! Can't wait to meet her.
Lady of the Puddle: And to you, Ferbalot and Phineas, I bid thee good fortune! (turns into a wave of water and splashes on the boys)
Phineas: Wow, good thing she wasn't "Lady of the Hot Coffee." (at Linda) Mom! Ferb and I are going on a quest.
Linderella: (from inside the cottage) Don't forget to goad the geese on your way out!
Phineas: Sure thing, mom. (at a goose) Get in there, Gertrude!
(The goose flaps into the yard, honking angrily.)
Phineas: (opens the gate door) Whoa! This must be the sprite, Isabel!
Isabel: What art thou doin'? (curtseys)
Phineas: Apparently you're going to guide us on a quest.
Isabel: Yes. You must first cross the Raging River of Uncertainty by way of the Bridge of Comprehension. Then you must brave the Swamp of Spit-Poor Attitudes; then it's snack time, I brought along some apples. After that, you will enter the Cave of Ten Thousand Monsters, where the sword Excaliferb can be found. (at Ferbalot) Ferb, only a warrior with a true heart may draw it from the stone and wield it in battle against the evil sorcerer Malifishmirtz.
(Phineas glances at Ferbalot)
Ferbalot: (after a short pause) Yeah, okay, I'm down with that.
Isabel: (at Phineas) Do you have any questions?
Phineas: Yeah, where's Parable? 
(Scene shows Parable walking through the forest then puts on his hat and runs to the tower where he climbs what looks like hair. When he reaches the top it turns out to be a king with a long mustache.)
Monopunzel: Good morning Sir P. (the feather in Parable's hat shoots out) The tempest we're experiencing was conjured up by the evil Malifishmirtz, we need you to fly up to his evil fortress and put the kibosh on his evil machinations.
(Parable flies off) 
(The scene shifts back to Major Monogram's room)
Major Monogram: I really like that character; is there going to be more about him?
Carl: I'm sorry, sir, he just comes in at the beginning. Shall I continue? (Major Monogram mumbles under his breath) Huh?
Major Monogram: OK.
Carl: Meanwhile, back at the cottage of the humble antique dealer... 
(Scene changes to inside the cottage with Candavere and Linderella)
Candavere: Mom, I'm telling you; they're gallivanting around out there conjuring things with magical elixirs.
Linderella: Candavere, I've never see them gallivant.
Candavere: (sighs in frustration) When are you going to believe me? What if I got you some proof?
Linderella: I'd rather you got me some more grulewood.
Candavere: Fine. (leaves the cottage, talks to herself) Candavere, fetch me grulewood. Candavere, rake the roof-thatch. Candavere, go accuse the neighbors of witchcraft. If only I had some (sees the potions) proof! (grabs two of them) All I have to do is grab a couple of these to show Mom and (trips causing the potions to spill on her) Oof! Ugh. What is this stuff? (a unicorn horn appears on her head) Ahh, stupid potion! I know, maybe this will get rid of it. (pours another potion on her head) That didn't work. I'm going to go tell Mom. (turns around and sees a tail) Aaugh! Oh, great a tail! Phineas and Ferbalot, you are so bu.. (breaths fire) I can't go to the Midsummer Woad-Gathering Harvest Bonfire like this. What will Jeremiad think? I'm just gonna have to find Phineas and Ferb and make them tell me which one of these elixirs will change me back. (grabs some potions and runs, but trips again causing all of them to spill on her making different colored smoke to appear) Ah! Oh this is not, oh no. Oh. Oh, there's a... oh no. Oh... 
(scene changes to Malifishmirtz's fortress)
♪ Malifishmirtz Evil Incorporated, but not really a corporation because corporations haven't been invented yet so it's more like a guild or a tradesmen association! ♪
(Parable flies to Malifishmertz's fortress and breaks down the door)
Malifishmirtz: Ah-ha! Parable the Dragonpus, welcome to your doom! (aims his staff to shoot magic at Parable but doesn't work) Hey, wha-what's the matter with this thing? Hey-Hey Gnorme, can you come out here and give me a hand?
Gnorme: Of course! (walks in and drops a cage on Parable)
Malifishmirtz: Do you like him, Parable the Dragonpus? I call him a Lawn Gnorme. He protects my garden from witches' spells and wood trolls. I'm going to make small versions of him and sell them all over... Anyway, let me tell you about my plan for seizing control of the Tri-Kingdom Area. (walks down the tower) You see, I was bullfrog hunting down by the rat catcher's shack and came across a... (muffled sound from going around the back of the stairs) ...the biggest raspberry I've ever seen! It was the size of a cucumber! (muffled sound) ...is what I said because I had a gag over my mouth. (muffled sound continues until he reached the bottom) ...and that's why I decided to take over the Tri-Kingdom Area! True story. And now, I know exactly how to do it! You see, I found this ancient text, more of a-- a pamphlet really, and decided to use it to conjure up the most evil multitude to ever tread the Earth! But to do that, I needed to start with the most hideous substance known to man: Canned meat! Tripe-Henge Brand, only the best! So, earlier today, I placed thousands of cans of canned meat into the largest of my three cauldrons, cast my evil reanimation spell, and ta-da! (Gnorme dumps them out of the cauldron, and the small meatlings begin chattering "meat") Yeah, don't say it, I know, they're—they're a little small, but that's why the rain, see? They absorb water, and they will grow, and when they get bigger, I'm hoping their attitude will become a little more, you know, rampage-y. 
Phineas: Isabel, why did you take us to the Inn of the Prancing Platypus?
Isabel: We need allies. There's a lot of mercenaries and thugs to choose from. Plus, they make a great taco salad.
Phineas: Who's that creepy guy? He's been staring at us since we got here. I wonder what he wants...
Isabel: He's coming over! Be cool.
Bufavulous: I would recommend a little more caution from you, wizardling. Malifishmirtz's spies are everywhere. Look at that guy over there.
Phineas: He doesn't look like a spy; he looks more like a shepherd.
Bufavulous: He's a shepherd spy. They're the worst kind.
Phineas: Are you a mercenary thug?
Bufavulous: Actually I'm here for the taco salad. But you guys look like you could do with a little muscle. The name's Bufavulous, the Wind Lord. I can help you on your quest.
Phineas: Welcome aboard!
Bufavulous: You should also know that I travel with a companion by the name of Baljeetolas, of the Nerdling Realm.
Baljeetolas: Greetings, adventurers! If by my bow, or my vast store of useless knowledge I may aid you... Hey, where is my bow?
Bufavulous: You left it in the booth.
Baljeetolas: Oh, excuse me. Well, there it is. Has anyone seen my arrows?
Bufavulous: Bathroom!
Isabel: Now that we're all congregated, we must away!
Bufavulous: Let everyone now task his thought, that this fair quest may on foot be brought!
(The five begin their quest accompanied by banjo music) 
Monogram: Whoa, hey, whoa, hold it. What's with the banjo?
Carl: Traveling music.
Monogram: Where are they going, Alabama?
Carl: What do you mean, sir?
Monogram: Well, uh, questing music should have an element of foreboding and mystery, you know, lots of minor chords and stuff. And, to make it sound more medieval, you throw a major chord in right at the end.
Carl: (sighs) Okay, I'll see what I can do. And so, the merry band set off on their quest, to the foreboding sounds of minor chords. Better?
Monogram: Little less sarcasm would be nice.

Malifishmirtz: What do you know, my shepherd spy tells me that a team of erstwhile heroes bent on defeating me are on their way here right now.
(The spy whispers something else in Malifishmirtz's ear)
Malifishmirtz: Oh, yeah, sure. It's just down that way, past the Sally-port on your right. You can't miss it! 
(The group come to a bridge spanning what looks to be a gorge)
Phineas: A bridge.
Baljeetolas: Are not these kind of things guarded in these types of stories?
Bufavulous: Yeah, like by a troll?
Troll: (Appears in a puff of smoke) Do I look like a troll to you?
Baljeetolas: Do not answer truthfully; it will only enrage her.
Troll: In order to cross my Bridge of Comprehension, you must first answer three questions. The questions will fall into three categories: arts and sciences, social studies, and what's hot and what's not.
Baljeetolas: (Standing beneath the bridge in the creek bed) Uh, hey guys? It is not really that deep down here.
Troll: The answer must be given in haiku form.
Phineas: If it's all the same to you, we'll just go around.
Troll: It's not all the same to me.
(They cross the river)
Baljeetolas: Just for the record,
The answer to your riddle
is an egg. Bye now!
Troll: Come back! You can't ju... Wait a minute! Just-for-the-rec-ord The-an-swer-to-your-rid-dle is-an-egg-bye-now. Hum, what do you know, that was a haiku. 
Malifishmirtz: The time has come, my little meat gamejos. Rain down on my enemies, and stop them from advancing. And bring me back a newspaper. (Malifishmirtz fires them from a catapult and cackles) You too. Go. (He flings one more meatling) 
Phineas: Uh oh. Doesn't look good. (In reference to the giant gorge they are overlooking) Whoa.
Bufavulous: This is where that crazy old bat should have built her bridge.
Isabel: This is the Rocky, Shallow River of Nevermore.
Baljeetolas: Why must everything have such long names?
Phineas: We're going to have to turn around and find another way across this gorge.
(The meatlings land in front of them)
Bufavulous: Oh no, canned meat! Now we're in trouble.
Isabel: But they're so cute.
Phineas: They're getting bigger!
Bufavulous: And more rampagey!
(They are backed up to the cliff's edge)
Baljeetolas: Are quests usually this short?
Phineas: We're not going to go without a fight!
Isabel: Phineas! I want all of you to jump.
Phineas: Uh, you know that it's called the Rocky, Shallow River of Nevermore for a reason, right?
Isabel: I have a plan, just trust me!
Phineas: I don't know, how 'bout you Ferb? (Ferbalot jumps off the cliff) Should we... Ferb? He's right. Come on! (He jumps as well)
Bufavulous: Mother always told me that if all the other kids were jumping off a cliff, I should, too.
Baljeetolas: Your mother said that?
Bufovulous: She was not a nurturer. Let's go!
(They both jump off)
Phineas: Isabel, if you're going to do something, now would be a nice time! (The screen freezes with the four of them all in midair) 
Major Monogram: Carl, you- you stopped!
Carl: I think we need to take a little break.
Major Monogram: Wow, bad time for that. You totally left me hanging in that cliff scene.
Carl: That's kinda the point, sir.
Major Monogram: Oh, I see. Very clever. 
(Scene opens in the backyard at the Flynn-Fletcher house)
Lawrence: Goodbye boys, have a great day, I'm off to work.
Phineas: Goodbye dad, have fun buying from auctions and private sales performing minor refurbishments to the purchase items, marking up the price and then selling them to your customers!
Ferb: (To the camera) Our dad sells antiques.
Phineas: You know Ferb, it's strange how we wave our hands when we say goodbye. It seems so arbitrary. Why don't people jump up and down or stick out their tongues, or slap their thighs?
(Ferb makes a gesture)
Phineas: Well, if by that you mean we should create a whole new form of communication, then I couldn't agree more! That was some nice gesturing, Ferb. Do some more!
(Ferb does more gestures)
Phineas: Ah. I...know...what...we're...going...to do...spatula! Oh, today...I really should have known that from the context.
(Ferb does more gestures)
Phineas: Oh, here's another one! Hey...where's...spatula! Oh, context again... 
(Cut to Perry walking into the bathroom, presses a red O.W.C.A. button, and Major Monogram is shown in the mirror.)
Major Monogram: Ah Agent P. Sorry I'm running a little late this morning. Our satellites haven't picked up any Inator activity coming from Doofenshmirtz, but that's no indication that he isn't up to something. We want you to get down there and have a little look-see. Good hunting Agent P.
(Perry runs out and Monogram puts on aftershave and then screams in horror.) 
(Cut to the boys in the backyard writing on whiteboard while Candace looks on from inside the house)
Phineas: Finally when someone sneezes rather than say gesundheit, just play flugelhorn and give him your left shoe. I think we nailed down the non-verbal cues. Now let's look at the syntax! 
Linda: Candace? What's wrong, honey?
Candace: Mom, they're doing stuff out there!
Linda: (looks at the boys) Candace, they're just writing on a whiteboard.
Candace: Yes, that's it, they're plotting. And you know what that leads to. Implementing-guh!
Linda: Candace, you need to lighten up a little. Take it easy. Do you know what I do to relax?
Candace: You eat some pie and then laid down on that old sensory deprivation tank we keep in the basement.
Linda: That's right! Would you like to try it?
Candace: Um, I'm gonna go with no, but thank you.
Linda: Well you should still try to relax.
Candace: Mom, I don't need to relax, I need to bust Phineas and Ferb.
Linda: Well listen sweetie, you said so yourself, they're just plotting, right? That gives you plenty of time to go to the mall before they start implementing-guh. (makes hand gestures)
Candace: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense! Maybe—Hey, wait a second, are you making fun of me?
Linda: Maybe just a little. (leaves)
Candace: She's right, I probably have plenty of time to go to the mall! 
(Cut to backyard)
Phineas: Okay, Ferb, let's start implementing! 
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! ♪ 
(Perry flies in. Doofenshmirtz and Norm are standing there.)
Doofenshmirtz: (adjusting something on Norm's back) Just one more bolt right behind- (Perry♪) So, Perry the Platypus, we meet again! But this time, the advantage is mine... (to Norm) Hey, what are you waiting for Norm, we rehearsed this like a thousand times! I say "Ah, Perry the Platypus, we meet again, only this time the advantage is mine", you go and get him!
Norm: Going and getting!
Doofenshmirtz: (writing) Note to self, say the --- for replacing Norm's head. (Norm captures Perry in a bag) Okay, much better (to Perry) this is a good look for you! 
(Cut to backyard, Isabella enter to find Phineas and Ferb with Baljeet and Buford.)
Isabella: Hi guys. Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Erb-Ferb Atin-Lerb!
Isabella: Oh, creating a whole new form of communication today, are we?
Phineas: Yeah, what do you think?
Isabella: Sounds fun! What do you call it?
Phineas: Ferb Latin! Where you take the first letter of every word, move it to the end, and then you say erb! So Ferb becomes erb-ferb, and Latin becomes atin-lerb! Two letter words stay the same, like or stays or. All the fun of Pig Latin, and it's safe for vegetarians to use!
Isabella: Oh, Phineas, I think your new language is onderful-werb!
Phineas: By Jove, I think she's got it! But there's also a lot of non-verbal cues! For example, if you wanna say okay, you reach for the sky!
Buford: Yeah! And when you're hungry, you crack your knuckles! (cracks knuckles) Oh, baby, that's good...
Phineas: And if you smell something bad, you do jazz hands!
Baljeet: (to Buford) Stop looking at me, I'm not going to do jazz hands! Even though you have totally earned it...
Isabella: How do you say goodbye?
Phineas: When you say goodbye, you blow a raspberry! (blows a raspberry) Let's all do it!
(Everyone starts blowing raspberries, including Irving who only pops his head a moment. After a while, they stop and Phineas chuckles and sighs. Then there's a long pause and they all start again.) 
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated)
Doofenshmirtz: I bet you're wondering where my Inator is, right? C'mon, guess? Guess, no? No? Can I get a play-Oh alright ergh alright. Don't play. It's Norm!
Norm: Let's hope there's no self-destruct button on this one!
Doofenshmirtz: You've always had one, Norm. I just never told you where it was so you wouldn't pick at it!
(Norm's eyes grow bigger and his mouth falls off)
Doofenshmirtz: And stop interrupting me! Anyway, I've done a lot of research for the past... you know, few hours... and I, and I found that most people will believe anything they read! And I know it's true, 'cause you know... I read it online somewhere. So, my new weapon to take over the Tri-State Area is... propaganda!
Norm: Propaganda consists of messages that dishonestly attempt to influence the attitude of a community!
Doofenshmirtz: Thanks for that, Mr. Norm-It-All. I've installed a switch back here that prints out propaganda leaflets. All I have to do is speak my evil messages into this microphone, err let's see... eh, "slap yourself"! Push this button and, whatever I say (presses button and leaflet comes out) comes printed out on a leaflet. It's gonna work! I'm using a very convincing font. It's bold and it has a lot of serifs!
Norm: Serifs are semi-structural details that...
Doofenshmirtz: (cuts off Norm) Oh, for crying out loud, Norm! Listen, here's a buck, why don't you go get out of here and get a haircut or something!
Norm: Out I go! (Going with Perry still in hand)
Doofenshmirtz: Uh, Norm, take the dollar and leave the platypus.(He hands Norm the dollar, who puts Perry on the floor then walks out right through the wall) And when you come back use the door! (to Perry) He gets that from you, you know. Anyway, my plan is to fly Norm all over the Tri-State Area and drop leaflets, then everyone will do my bidding!
(Doofenshmirtz looks at the leaflet and slaps himself)
Doofenshmirtz: Man, that really is a convincing font. 
(Cut to Phineas and Ferb and their gang walking to an ice cream stand)
Ice cream guy: Hi, kids, what'll it be?
Phineas: Ocolate-Cherb.
Isabella: Awberry-Strerb.
Baljeet: Anilla-Verb.
Buford: Emon-Lerb.
Ferb: Erry-Cherb.
Ice cream guy: Are you kids from outta town?
Phineas: No no, we're speaking Ferb Latin! You move the first letter to the end of the word then add erb! One and two letter words stay the same.
Ice cream guy: Oh, I get it! Ocolate-Cherb is chocolate, and anilla-verb is vanilla!
Woman #1: Ooh, at's-therb ute-cerb.
(The kids leaves with their ice creams while blowing raspberries)
Woman #1: Did..that mean goodbye?
Ice cream guy: I'm gonna roll with it. 
(Cut to Candace at the mall)
Woman #2: Are you having trouble relaxing?
Candace: A little...
Woman #2: Try our new liquid massage. This isn't your mother's sensory deprivation tank. A few minutes in here will change your world!
Candace: Alright, strap me in! 
(Cut to Norm having a haircut)
Barber #1: Ice-nerb ay-derb.
Customer: Es-yerb it is.
Norm: Hey, what's that language they're speaking?
Barber #2: That is Ferb Latin!
Norm: I like it! And intend to use it whenever I can. Tell me how it works. 
(Cut to the gang walking down the street. They all click their tongues then blow raspberries to someone. They approach a TV news-anchor and a cameraman.)
Gordon Gutsofanemu: Hey, I hear you kids have invented a new language. Tell us all about it!
Phineas: Sure, follow me!

Doofenshmirtz: You're a weird robot, Norm.
Norm: Ank-therb ou-yerb!

Candace: (runs around the corner) This whole town has gone crazy!
Phineas: (on TV) Ferb Latin isn't just a language, it's a way of life! (Candace turns around to see that Phineas and Ferb is on TV)
Candace: Ferb Latin? I should have known Phineas and Ferb were behind this! (to the boys on TV) You are so usted-berb!
(Candace dials a number and Linda picks up her phone while lying in the tank)
Linda: What is it Candace? (Candace asks something) No, I don't know what Ferb Latin is. (sighs) Give me fifteen minutes.

(Leaflets are printed out with "Talk Normal" written on them) Oh, great. That was not the message I wanted to deliver to the people of the Tri-State Area! (A couple catches one)
Steve: Talk normal. Huh.
Ann: Yeah okay I'm convinced. 
(Cut to Candace dragging Linda)
Candace: Mom mom mom! Come with me. Phineas and Ferb created a new language and everybody's speaking it, and now we can't understand anybody! Watch this! What time is it?
Heather: Twenty minutes since the last time you asked me.
Candace: What? You there! Talk!
Man #1: I don't think we have anything to say to each other! Not after the... jazz hands!

Candace: (pause, stands up) I'm telling Mom. (She leaves to do so)
Phineas: I think she liked it.

Jeremy: So, Candace, you made a teddy bear out of baklava?
Candace: Yeah, bears like honey. Bakalva's made with honey. (tastes some of her baklava bear)
Jeremy: (on phone) Oh, so it's like a statement?
Candace: You think it's weird, don't you?
Jeremy: No, not weird, it's just-- (a customer walks up) Oh, wait, I got a customer, Candace. I'll - I'll call you later, okay?
Candace: (hangs up) He thinks it's weird. Why is it that when Phineas and Ferb have an idea, everyone's like (deep voice) "Oh, wow, you guys are really clever!" (normal voice) And when I come up with something, everyone goes "What? Did you say something, Candace?" (picks up the baklava bear, now covered with ants) Oh you know what I'm talking about, baklava bear. Ew! (after seeing the ants, she quickly throws the bear onto the ground)
Phineas: Hey, Candace. Have you just seen a chicken wearing a baseball hat run by here?
Candace: No, why?
Phineas: It was his turn to bat and-- (notices the ants harvesting the broken baklava bear) Ooh! Are you still using these ants?
Candace: Those aren't my ants! Do whatever you want with them. (goes inside the house)
Phineas: Look, Ferb. Wouldn't it be great to be part of an ant society? They're so efficient and productive. They're like tiny "us-es". Hey, speaking of us, where's Perry? 
(Switches to Perry's lair. Perry enters to find Carl, an angry Major Monogram, and a broken screen)
Major Monogram: Sorry, Agent P. Your monitor is on the fritz today...thanks to someone who isn't aware that croquet is an outdoor game.
Carl: Again, sir, there was nothing on the box to indicate--
Major Monogram: Anyway, let's get this show on the road, shall we? (Carl hoists a cardboard replica of the screen and stops it with a rock) Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been collecting some extremely unusual items the last few days. Uh, some of the odd purchases include—Carl, where are my inserts?
Carl: Oh, sorry, sir. Do that last bit again.
Major Monogram: (while he is speaking, Carl holds up images of each items) Some of the odd purchases include: biomolecular components simply used to make organic computers, a giant pilgrim hat, and most curious of all, a huge pair of food booties, used on the end of turkey legs for decoration. You know, Carl, I really like working live, it reminds me of my days in the theater group back at...The Academy.
(Flashback)
(people booing)
Man 1: Francis, you stink!
Man 2: Get off the stage!
(Flashback ends)
Major Monogram: Anywho, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to something sinister. Find out what it is and report back. Monogram, out. Carl, fade out. (Carl pushes a button on a remote which turns the room pitch black, and the only things visible are the eyes of Agent P, Carl and Major Monogram) Man. You can go now, Agent P.

Phineas: Ladies and gentlemen, gape in awe at the sheer spectacle that is...the Antius Maximus!
(Ferb unveils the prototype version of the said invention, as a fly hits it)
Buford: Heh, more like the Anti-Cli-maximus. (elbows Baljeet) Hehheh, yeah?
Baljeet: (sarcastically) Yes, I got it.
Phineas: Oh that was just a scale model to get the investors interested. This is the real thing.
(screen pans over to the real version of the Antius Maximus)
Baljeet: Woah!
Isabella: How did we miss that?
Phineas: And right over there is Ferb's resize-nizer.
Baljeet: What does that do?
Phineas: Well, you find an anthill and then, you add a scoop of it to the pot. Then, the ant Resize-inizer will rain enlarging fluid onto the dirt pile, and cause the ants to move towards the large synthostatic light, making them bigger. Then they continue to the Antius Maximus, the perfect place for the larger ants to live. In no time, we should have an ant farm filled with giant ants. Or Gi-ants.
Isabella: (she and Baljeet applaud) Nice one!
Baljeet: Oh, Clever wordsmithing, good sir!
Phineas: Thank you.
Buford: Oh, fine. And I just get an eye-roll for Anti-Climaximus? 
(Switches to Candace in her room)
Candace: Oh, what the heck is that thing? (walks out) Oh, I'm gonna go tell Mom. 
(Switches to the exterior of the Antius Maximus, everyone is wearing headbands with ant antennae)
Phineas: In order to move amongst the ants without upsetting them, we need to douse ourselves in ant pheromones. It's sort of like ant cologne, which will make them think that we're one of them. But not too much! We don't want them getting too friendly! (presses a yellow button)
Buford: Bum bum bum...
Baljeet: Stop it, Buford.
(A pink gust of ant pheromones covers everyone, and an orchestral chord stings. Everyone but Phineas and Ferb scream and cough)
Buford: It smells like my grandma's house!
Isabella: Why does your grandmother's house smell like ant pheromone?
Buford: Have you met my grandma?
(They go inside)
Isabella: Let's go see what the ants think of our new cologne.
Phineas: You know what I like about our friends? We say things like "We're gonna douse you with ant pheromones" and they're just like "Okay, whatever". They're so cool! 
(Switches to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, where Perry uses his grappling hook to climb to the top of the structure and gets trapped in a pilgrim hat)
Doofenshmirtz: Ha! (opens the buckle door) Perry the Platypus?
(Perry nudges his head down to a point where part of his face is visible)
Doofenshmirtz: There's my guy. Why the Thanksgiving-themed trap, you may ask? You know how you get all and lethargic after you eat Thanksgiving dinner? Well, it's not because you're really full and, you know, slightly out of shape. It's because of all the tryptophan in the turkey. Now imagine, if the turkey were say the size of...a car or a building, there would be no resisting the tryptophanicle level of nature's little sleeping potion. That—is why—I created: the Turkey-inator! (pauses for dramatic effect) Wait, can you—can you see it from that little door, or do I have to move the hat, or—you're good? You're good. With this, I will fly over the city turning things into turkey all willy nilly, then—no one will be able to resist the all of that perfectly cooked turkey, goodness. And once the tryptophan cooks in, I'll take over the Tri-State Area with ease! Won't that be trypto-fun? Heeheehee. You know, "tryptophan", trypto...it's...you know, like...I'm wasting all this wordsmithing on a platypus.

Linda: (offscreen) Candace, you know Wednesday is my Famous Statues Life Drawing class. (she is dressed as the Statue of Liberty) This had better be important...
Candace: Mom, Phineas and Ferb are building a huge glass and sand thing in the yard, it looks like a giant ant farm, but I don't know what it does!
Linda: Candace, please--
Vivian: (offscreen) Hold still, Linda!
Linda: (through teeth) Look, Candace, this is just gonna have to wait until I can take a break.
Candace: But Mom, they're abusing their liberty! Don't you find that ironic?
Linda: Not enough to act upon right now, dear.
Candace: (leaving) Okay, fine. 
(Switches back to Evil Incorporated)
Doofenshmirtz: So long, Perry the Platypus! Next time you see me, I will be the indisputable ruler of the Tri-State Area! (flies off on his inator) And when I say "indisputable", I mean totally disputable! Wait, no, no that doesn't work, I mean...uh-uh-putable! I-I mean puta—no. Eh, the moment's gone.

Candace: Phineas and Ferb, let me in! (pushes button; gets covered in ant pheromones) Ew! What the heck is wrong with this doorbell?! Hello? (pushes button again; gets covered in more pheromones) Ow! Oh, it got in my eyes! (pushes button once again; gets covered in more pheromones) Hellooooo?! (presses it three more times) Ugh, it tastes like Buford's grandmother's house! That is it! (goes inside Antius Maximus) When I lay my hands on them, aha! (while inside) Phineas and Ferb, you are soooo buuuu... (seeing giant ant) bu......bu...buggy? Yeah, uh, you know what? (chuckles) This is the wrong giant ant farm. I'm just gonna head out, okay? But being a job on the whole digging thing, really. Okay? (sees another ant) Oh, hello, yeah, take it easy.

Phineas: The pheromones! Oh, that's why the ants think you're their queen! So, what's it like to have millions of ants at your beck and call?
Candace: Oh, it's great. Finally, someone understands my ideas. Only, they keep bringing me crumbs and grasshopper legs. I could really go for a salad. (an ant goes to make a salad) And you think, they'd have a fancy queen dress, or something. (another ant goes to make a dress)

Phineas: Candace! You've gotta see what the ants are up to! I think you really made an impression on them. Candace: So, what'd they do?
Phineas: Well, you asked for a salad and a queen dress, so first, they evolved from a hunter-and-gatherer society, to an agrarian society. Look, they mastered farming in less than 10 minutes.
Baljeet: Then, they put it all together to make you this salad. There are still grasshopper legs in it, but other than that, it is not bad.
Phineas: Then, three minutes ago, they had an Industrial Revolution. Check it out! They're weaving the fabrics needed to make a dress for you!
Isabella: Wow, Candace, you're probably the most progressive Ant Queen ever!
Candace: This is so cool! I should call Jeremy and tell him. (looks at cell phone) Oh, there's no service in here. Nice. (at three of the ants) You there! Make there be cell service for your queen!
Phineas: You think that's a good idea?
Candace: Oh, like you'd never tamper with the delicately balanced, yet awesome power of nature. 
(Switches back to the Turkey-inator)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, Perry the Platypus, take that! And that! (gets head stuck in control board) Oh! Oh, man, that's disgusting! Still, it can't be the first time someone's got their head stuck in a turkey.

Ant: Greetings, Phineas. We have achieved total enlightenment, and have transcended the need of maternal things, like ant farms.
Phineas: Wow! Good for you!
Ant: Our new colony will traverse the galaxy in search of the fabled Picnic Planet. (the Turkey-inator hits the Antius Maximus, turning it into an over-sized cooked turkey)
Oh, good, turkey! We can take that with us as an in-flight snack! Goodbye, Phineas and Ferb.

Phineas: Goodbye! Have a good time evolving past the need for physical existence!

Linda: Oh, yes. I see. (at Phineas, Ferb, and their friends) Greetings, human-sized ants.
Phineas: Hi, Mom!
Candace: No! There were actually ants the size of people! (puts crown on head) See?! I was their queen!
Phineas: Yeah, Mom. Candace inadvertently caused the ants to evolve.
Candace: Exactly, and I was their queen!
Linda: Wow, Candace. Just like on Mars. (walks away waving)
Candace: I was—I -- Oh, forget it, I'm gonna go call Jeremy. (walks off, cell phone in hand)

Ferb: Yes. Probably while we're having a picnic.

Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus, be a dear and help a brother out. Can't seem to -- (Perry takes the control board off his head) Oh! Oh, thanks. (Turns around) No! What are you doing?!
(Perry points the control board in such a way, the Turkey-inator hits itself, turning it into an oversized turkey. He then escapes, via para-sail, before the turkey catches fire while falling towards the street.) Curse you, Perry the Platypus...! (When hitting the ground, the turkey forms a massive explosion.)
Doofenshmirtz: (groans) I feel like a giblet.

Buford: Guys, can you settle an argument for us? Preferably in my favor? If a vegetarian becomes a zombie, would they start eatin' people? (referring to Baljeet) Mr. Smartyunderpants thinks they just keep eatin' vegetables.
Baljeet: But they are, after all, vegetarians.
Phineas: I guess they eat things like heads of lettuce...uh, ears of corn!
Baljeet: Eye of potato!
Buford: Leg of carrot! (Baljeet looks up questionably) What? Your carrots don't have legs? Where do your parents shop?
Isabella: Hey, guys! What'cha doin'?
Phineas: Oh, we're just solving the world's problems.
Baljeet: Zombie vegetarianism is a world problem?
Phineas: Not yet. But recycling is. We've gotta lot of leftover material from past inventions and we're tryin' to figure out what to do with it.
Buford: My mom always just throws all the leftovers into a pot and makes a giant casserole. (to Isabella) It's best to just eat first and ask questions later.
Phineas: That's it! We'll use all our leftovers and make an invention casserole! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry?

Linda: (putting a burnt pie on the floor by Perry) Oh, here you go, Perry. (Perry unwillingly sinks his teeth into the pie) I burnt another one. (Shot of Linda as she takes her oven mitts off. She looks rather baggy-eyed.) I guess that's what I get for staying up all night. Unless I get my act together that means plenty more for you, Perry.

Lawrence: Ooh, fine idea. There's nothing teenagers love more than listening to speeches.

Okay, okay, it's mine! (blows a noisemaker) Help yourself, Agent P. (a piece of cake with a candle on it emerges from the floor but Perry refuses it) Not a cake person, huh? Oh, well. We've noticed a surge of revenue going to Doofenshmirtz's bank account recently. Get to the bottom of it. Are we ready to sing, Carl?
(Carl enters)
Carl: I'm patching in all the agents now, sir. We couldn't afford the rights to that famous birthday song, so the agents and I came up with this. (various O.W.C.A. agents appear on the monitor in separate boxes, Carl blows a pitch pipe) A one, a two, a three.

Carl: ♪ Birth-daaaaaaaaaaay! ♪
Major Monogram: (sniff) That was just beautiful!

Lawrence: (reading) "Thank you for coming here today to hear my speech on the history of the ancient Ornithorhynchan tribe. (At this point, Candace's eyes begin to become heavy and she tries in vain to stay awake.) The Ornithorhynchans were a platypus-worshipping society known for painting themselves teal-blue and wearing elaborate platypus-themed costumes for their various dances and rituals."
Candace: (looking at her watch) Oh, you know what? I just remembered some friends asked me to help them form a giant human pyramid and I told them that was, like, the last thing I want to do today, but it turns out I was wrong. So I-I gotta go. (leaves) The speech is great, Dad, (puts her hands on her father's shoulders) but you might want to add some visual aids. Just a little dry.
Lawrence: Hmmm, visual aids. Ah, that's how I can (rolling his r's) sprruce it up a little. Sprrrruce! Sprrrrrruce! Spuuuuuuuuh-ruce! Ha ha ha, ah, very good then.

(Perry lets go of the hang-glider and rolls on the floor, but two mechanical hands trap him and lift him onto a doctor's chair with an optometrist's eye exam device on it.)
Doofenshmirtz: Good to see you, Perry the Platypus! But you will be lucky to see anything after y—Oop! Oh! I almost used my final zinger before I even told you my evil plan! Just put it out of your mind. Bzzt! It's gone like...like you've been zapped by a mind zap-inator....zapperinator or something. Hmmm. Anyway, you may be wondering why you're in an ophthalmologist's chair. Well, it seems that I've come into a bit of good fortuuuuune! Some technology of mine is being used to in eye examination equipment...
(Flashback to Doofenshmirtz getting his mail)
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) ...and I've been getting royalty checks. The extra money is fine and all, but it really chafes my hide (shot of Doofenshmirtz observing the equipment being used) that something I invented is being used for good! (grumbles)
(End flashback)
Doofenshmirtz: Eh, y'know what I mean? So, so I invented (takes down an inator from the ceiling) the Eye Fog-inator to temporarily blur the vision of whomever it hits. It will then force people to go out and get their eyes checked, and I'll get even more money, which I can then spend on EEEEEEEEE-VIL! So, y'know I, it kinda evens out. And you, Perry the Platypus, will be my first test subject! (He puts the equipment on Perry) Okay, put your little chin on the thing. (Takes out a cloth from his lab coat) Oh, oh, l-let me wipe that off for you. Gets so greasy. (adjusts the equipment) Okay, lift your head a bit, there-there we go. Perfect. (takes down the inator) Okay, here's my zinger: You'll be lucky to see anything after the eye fog-inat—Uch! It, y'know, it worked before when it was in context, but-but it just sounds silly now. N— (grumbles) Okay. (activates the inator) Now, now you'll feel a slight puff of air. (some gray smoke spews out of the inator) Okay, and then the blinding ray. (a red laser shoots out the device) So d-did it work? (Perry squints, point of view shot from the chair. We see a rather blurred image of Doofenshmirtz) Well, why are you giving me the stink eye? Did it work or not? (Perry simply shrugs his shoulders) Huh, uh, I guess I'll just have to try it on myself. (He aims the inator at himself) Okay, three steps back and... (the grey smoke and the red laser comes at his face) Wooooah! Woah I can see... (point of view shot from Doofenshmirtz, whose vision is just as blurry) ...that I cannot see. (waves his hand in front of his face) This... It... It works! (Perry escapes from the trap while Doofenshmirtz stammers) I can consider this a success, Perry... Perry the Platypus, where are you? (Perry attempts to kick Doofenshmirtz in the face but misses) Did you say something?

Phineas: Nice work, Baljeet!
Baljeet: I found some slide rulers from my World of Calculation exhibit.

(Cut back to D. E. I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Y'know, maybe I should've thought before blurring my own vision. It was very short sighted. Anyway, could you make that "digga-digga-digga-digga-digga" sound for me? (Perry kicks him in the jaw) That was a lucky kick, Perry t— (Perry kicks him again, Doofenshmirtz makes angry noises) Wait, I just need to blast myself again and I'll clear my vision and get the jump on him. (On the contrary, Perry jumps him first) Hey, hey, you jumped on me! You used my own turn of phrasing against me! Wow, irony! (He walks off camera and we hear a crash. Cut to a shot of Doofenshmirtz standing next to a scattered pile of buckets) Really? A stack of buckets? That'll teach me to randomly stack buckets in the center of my lab. 
(Cut back to the kitchen. Linda is still baking and burning)
Linda: Oh, another reject. Here you go, Perry. (turns around) Oh, there you are. What're you doing up there? (she sets the pie down and picks up what she thinks is Perry) Oh, it's a bag of bread. Haha! Oh, (rubs eyes) I've been up so long I'm starting to see things.
(Point of view shot from Linda. The bag of bread suddenly is wearing a top hat and dance shoes and holding a cane and does a high-kicking dance. Cut back to Linda who looks in disbelief and looks in another direction. Point of view shot at the burnt pies. One of them suddenly comes to life.)

Candace: Hello? 
(Cut back to Linda)
Linda: I hate to interrupt your day but... 
(Cut back to Candace)
Linda: (on phone) I need your help with these pies. I'm so tired I'm startin' to see the weirdest things.
Candace: Weird? (takes phone away from her ear) Yes! (back on phone) I'll be right home! (She comes out of the pyramid, which topples over.) Um...that was partially my fault! 
(Cut back to Linda)
Linda: (yawns) Ugh, the pies aren't the only things that are burnt.
(She hears someone doing some sort of chant. She looks in the direction. The chanting is coming from Lawrence who is all dressed in teal makeup, a teal-green robe, yellow moccasins, and a beaver tail.)
Linda: (exits) I gotta get outta here!
Lawrence: (sighs) That didn't go over as well as I'd hoped. Mmmm, perhaps I need to spuh-ruce it up more! Sprrrrrruce! Sprrrrrrrrrrrrrr—Ahh! Ooh! Ow! I do believe I've sprrrrrrrained my elbow.

(Perry is seen on top of the inator. He sticks his head in it and gets his vision back. He grabs one of the mechanical arms from the trap and destroys the inator with it.)

Candace: Heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee! This is gonna be epic! (She opens the gate and runs through.) Okay, Mom! (She gets zapped by the inator.) Here I am!

Balthazar: I can see everything so well now.
Father: Yes, whoever invented those gizmos inside that machine must be a person who is dedicated his or her life to good.

Linda: So, did you all have fun at the Bee Day Festival's Opening Ceremony?
Lawrence: It was bee-wildering.
Phineas: Bee-utiful.
Lawrence: Bee-dazzling.
Phineas: Bee-yond.
Lawrence: Bee-guiling.
Candace: (stops reading a magazine) Ugghh!! Just bee quiet!
Linda: Oh Candace, bee-have. (giggles) What's so important anyway?
Candace: Oh nothing, just taking the what-kind-of-teenager-are-you-quiz to unlock my true teen identity!
Linda: Well, I'll just leave that to the professionals at the magazine. (drives past an inflatable wading pool) Oh, look at that, an inflatable wading pool. Oh, it's just like the one I used to play with Candace when she was little. Remember, hon?
Candace: Mmmm-hmm!
Phineas: Ferb, I know what we're going to do today... and I'll tell you after the wipe.

Phineas: We're making the ultimate inflatable wading pool for Mom. Hey, where's Perry?

Major Monogram: Good morning, Agent P! We, ah, ah (sneezes) Sorry, I (coughs) My allergies are acting up. This whole Bee Day business is stirring up all the pollen in Danville. Anyway, Agent P, uh, Doof's been spotted gathering bee pheromones, which is not only disgusting but probably evil. To send you on your way, Carl actually came up with a bee-themed jetpack. It's right behind you. (a hatch opens behind Perry, holding a bee-themed jetpack) Carl! Where are those tissues?!
Carl: (hands a box of tissue) Here you go, sir.

Candace: (from the phone) No. (screams)
Stacy: Candace, talk to me.
Candace: (from the phone) Heather Magazine says I'm... (Cut to her) an emo teen!! An emo teen, Stacy! I don't even know what that is.
Stacy: Okay, to the Internet. (starts typing on her laptop) Here we go. Emos believe everyone's against them.
Candace: How can you say that to me?
Stacy: They're highly sensitive and drama queens.
Candace: No, I'm NOT!!!
Stacy: You know, as teenage sub-cultures go, it's not so bad. You just need a new look to match your true teen identity. I'll be right over. 
(Scene shifts to the backyard)
Phineas: Ferb, how's the pool inflation coming? (Ferb gives him a thumbs up)
Isabella: Hi Phineas, what'cha doin?
Phineas: Ferb and I are building a super inflatable wading pool. Wanna help?
Isabella: I'd love to, but actually, I need your help.
Phineas: Anything for you, Isabella.
Isabella: (romantically) Really?
Phineas: Sure. (passionately) Your word is my humble command. I would travel the four corners of the globe - which I have actually done - but this time, it would be for you.
(Scene changes to a beach, with Phineas rising on a rock in a white shirt and black pants with long red hair)
All for you!
Isabella: Ah...
Ginger: (offscreen) Ahem?!
(Scene changes back to reality)
Ginger: (whispers) You were lost in Phineasland again.
Isabella: (snaps out) Oh! Right. (chuckles) Right. The Fireside Girls are going for our Beekeeping patch, and we need to borrow something.
Phineas: Of course, but you're going to bring some collateral if you wannna borrow Ferb.

(Perry punches him again) Oh, I'm sorry, I-I can't help it, I got bees in the brain, especially the queen bee, You only hear about the queen bee this, queen bee that. You'll never hear about the King Bee, do you? That means there's a power vacuum that I need to exploit. (shows an -inator) Behold! The Aroma-nator. Like the queen bee, I have acquired mass quantities of pheromones. See? Right here in the tank. Once I spray myself, the bees will be attracted to me and I will be crowned King Bee! After that, it's just a hop, skip, and a jump to ruling the entire Tri-State Area. 
(Back at Candace's room, Stacy is holding the magazine wihle Candace is in her closet.)
Stacy: Okay, so the top three items on the Heather Magazine 11-step guide to be the true emo teen are dark hair, dark clothes, and pencil-thin jeans.
Candace: Ughh!
Stacy: Let's see what you got.
(Candace comes out of the closet, revealing an emo Candace.)
Heeeeey, not bad!
Candace: (weakly) Whatever.
Stacy: Well, you got the look and you got the attitude. Now there's just one last test to see if you're a true emo. Do you have enough ennui to resist the urge to bust your brothers? (Candace looks out the window, seeing her brothers building the pool) I don't think your Mom would approve.
Candace: Of course not! They're gonna be soooooo bus --
Stacy: Nuh, uh, uh, true identity, Candace!
Candace: (inhales heavily and exhales lower and lower until part of her hair covers her left eye) What's the point? No one understands me anyway.
Stacy: Wow, Heather Magazine is good! 
(In the backyard)
Isabella: Thanks for the loan, Phineas! We're sure to get our Beekeeping patch now.
Phineas: No problem, what are friends for, if not to reconfigure a sorbet machine that turns people into flies into a sorbet machine that turns people into bees! Just remember, the effect wears off after a couple of hours. Why don't you come back for our inflatable wading pool party after your patch ceremony?
Isabella: Of course! Wouldn't miss it!
Ginger: This is fascinating! Tell me more about bee dancing.
Baljeet: Really? Because usually, people are either gone or fall asleep by the time I get to this part of the sentence.
Phineas: Hey, Baljeet! Mind giving me a hand with these pools?
Baljeet: (looks away from Ginger) In a minute. (Turns around) So to continue, the figure eight and... (Notices Ginger has disappeared) Awwww, annnnnd we are back. 
(In the kitchen, Candace walks in.)
Linda: Hi, honey. Love the new look.
Candace: You obviously don't know me. Nobody does. And if somebody did, I'd just deny it.
Linda: Sweetie, I went through a similar phase when I was your age. Try writing some poems.
Candace: Whatever.

Doofenshmirtz: (carrying a vacuum cleaner) Okay, time to fill the void in the power vacuum. 'Cause you see, it's a-it's a real vacuum cleaner. (Perry gives a look) No? Wow, either I'm off my game or you're just being stubborn. (Doofenshmirtz activates the vacuum and all the bees get sucked inside) Ha ha! Sucks to bee you! So we're back in business! Now, lemme just shut off this baby—Oops! I almost hit the self-destruct button here! What? I-I install one on everything. It's my thing. I put one on my coffee machine, on my TV, (cut to a shot of Doofenshmirtz's toilet with a self-destruct button on it) I have one everywhere. (cut back to Doofenshmirtz) I even put one on my underwear. See? Look. (he activates his underwear's self-destruct button) Oof! Oh, that, uh...that was not pleasant.

Buford: Alright, gang's all here. Let's get this pool party started!
Phineas: Sorry, Buford, I promised Isabella and the Fireside Girls that we'd wait for them.
Buford: (falsetto) "Ooh, I promised Isabella!"
Phineas: Is that how I sound?
Ferb: He really nailed you.
Baljeet: It is uncanny.
Phineas: Well, I guess we can test the pools out to make sure they're up to our usual standards.
Buford: (falsetto) "Well, I guess we can test the pools! Hey, look at me!"
Phineas: (laughs) You guys are right! It's like listening to a mirror! Alright, gang, let's give this wading pool a try.

Buford: Woohoo!
(Phineas laughs as he goes into the next pool and onto another slide, followed by Ferb)
Buford: (belches, giving a thumbs up) Carbonation. Makes me belch. That's why I like it.
Baljeet: (sarcastically) Yes, thank you for sharing.
(Cut to an icy pool. The gang falls down the slide onto the pool and go onto tubes on the next slide. Cut to another slide.) 
(Cut back to D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Now that the bees are out of the way, let's try this baby out. Just a little spritz. (He activates the Aroma-inator and gets more than just a little spritz.) Uh...okay...needs a little adjustments. (The doorbell rings) Oh, that's right. Charlene's coming over to get Vanessa's headphones for her. (He walks over to the door with the headphones and opens it to reveal his ex-wife.)
Charlene: Hello, Heinz.
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, Charlene. (giving her the headphones) Here ya go.
Charlene: (taking the headphones) Oh, thanks, Heinz. Wait, are you more attractive all of a sudden?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, why, thank you, I have been trying to—Oh, wait, no, it's just the pheromones.
Charlene: Wow! Well, it's really working because suddenly I can't remember why we broke up.
Doofenshmirtz: You said you hated Mr. Tomato.

Mr. Tomato: Hello, Charlene.
Charlene: Oh, hello, Mr. Tomato. (to her ex-husband) Thanks for the reminder. (leaves) I'm outta here.

It hits both the forward/reverse switch and the on/off switch) as I spritz myself right into ruining the Tri-State Area!

(Perry uses his tail like a chainsaw freeing himself from the swatter trap while Doofenshmirtz is still yelling.) Stop it stop it! (Perry puts his fedora back on) Ah! Ow! They're all over me! Ahhhhh!!! Get 'em off! Get 'em off!!!! (Perry runs over to the remote. He activates the Aroma-inator emptying it completely. The bees follow it.) Thank you for saving me, Perry the Platypus! And on the bright side, with all those bees, not one sting! Ow! (He spits out a bee and sticks out his swollen tongue.) Oh, man! I thould've ekthpected thith. At leatht my inator ith intact.

Yeah, well, thee, you thould be able to get it in contektht.

Buford: What the heck is that?
("Flight of the Bumblebee" plays in the background while all the bees surround the giant wading pool.)
Phineas: I have no idea, but the bees sure seem to like it.
(The bees take the giant wading pool with them all the way up.)
Candace: And so continues the inevitability of my mundane existence. (The bees deflate the giant wading pool, squirting water out of it, and soaking Candace) Once again, I am humiliated by the universe.
(The Ducky Momo pool drops down along with its water.)
Buford: What just happened?
Linda: (offscreen) Hey, kids! (Cut to the sliding door where Linda comes out with a tray with a pitcher and some glasses filled with iced tea) Anyone up for some iced tea?
Phineas: Sure! Thanks, Mom! (They run up to the refreshments. Perry enters chattering.) Oh, there you are, Perry!
Linda: Oh, look, you kids found Candace's old wading pool! How sweet!
Phineas: We're gonna have a pool party! Go ahead, wade away!
(Cut to the fence gate. Isabella, Gretchen and Holly enter in their swimwear carrying towels.)
Isabella: Sorry we're late, Phineas. Our bee ceremony ran long.
Phineas: No worries, Isabella. Go ahead and join Mom in the fun.
Buford: (falsetto) "No worries, Isabella!" (makes mocking noises)
Isabella: (to Phineas) Hey, he does a good you! (to Gretchen and Holly) Come on, girls! Let's hit the pool!
(Cut to Linda taking her shoes off and dipping her feet into the pool followed by Isabella, Holly and Gretchen.)
Linda: Aw, it's just like old times.
Stacy: (coming in with the magazine) Hey, Candace, (flipping the pages) I just realized you added up your score wrong! Your true teen identity is actually the... (Shows quiz in magazine) "Busting and Crush Obsessed Older Sister Type Who Can't Do Math".

Holly: It's my favorite part of Bee Awareness Day!
Katie: My favorite part is the B-flat with the F-sharp bass at the end of the song! (They all look at her.) What? It's tradition!
Isabella: Okay, girls, festivities are over. Let's focus on getting our beekeeping patches. It's the only patch that we've ever tried to get and failed. Remember last year?
(Flashback ripples, needle scratch as Gretchen runs up.)
Gretchen: (Interrupting Isabella's flashback) Eep! You promised to never flashback on that ever again.
Isabella: Right, right! You're right. (Walks outside to a yard with a bee hive in the middle.) But still, if we don't succeed today, the two strikes and you're out rule kicks in, which means this spot will stay empty on our sashes forever! (Close up on her sash showing an outlined mark, she gasps and sniffles)
Gretchen: Chill out, Isabella. We've got this. Ready, girls? (She pulls off the top of the hive)
Fireside Girls: (Gasp) They're gone!
Isabella: Gone? F-f-f-fighting flashforward to potential catastrophe! (Screen ripples, record scratches) Hey, where's Pinky?
(Scene switches to Pinky, who jumps into the purse of a mannequin. He passes Perry in a tunnel and barks.)
Admiral Acronym: Good afternoon, Agent Pinky. I see you've taken our new handbag conveyor system. (Pinky growls) Carla here has intelled that Poofenplotz has been hatching some sort of bee-related evil scheme. Carla?
Carla: Yes, it seems that Poofenplotz is researching the use of royal jelly in the bee community. (Beeping) Oh, there's your coffee.
Admiral Acronym: Isn't she a find? She comes from an entire family of unpaid interns. Anyways, see if there is anything to Carla's research, Agent Pinky. Admiral Acronym out.
(Pinky salutes and jet packs off.)
(Scene switches to the Fireside Girls' lodge.)
Isabella: (shrieks) We've gotta find those bees before the sun goes down! But how?
Gretchen: In the guideline for the beekeeping patch, it says that a good beekeeper tries to think like a bee.
Katie: Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
Gretchen: (annoyed) What are you doing?
Katie: I'm thinking like a bee!
Adyson: I know! We can get stung by radioactive bees and gain bee-themed superpowers!
Holly: Um...we don't have access to radioactive bees.
Ginger: (sarcastically) Yeah. That's what's wrong with that plan.
Isabella: But we do have access to Phineas and Ferb. And they have access to a sorbet machine that turned Candace into a fly. They've gotta be able to modify it to turn people into bees.
Katie: Phineas and Ferb have a sorbet machine that turns people into flies?
Isabella: Katie, for crying out loud, look it up on the Internet!

Poofenplotz: "We regret to inform you that..." Oh! Reject me, will they? No matter. (she crumples the paper up) My newest evil scheme is sure to catch the attention of that silly boy's club.

(She pushes a button on a remote and a makeup case pops out of the rug trapping Pinky.) The makeup case doubles as a trap. (She lifts it up.) Could you hand me that lipstick in there? (Pinky gives her the lipstick.) Thank you.

Phineas: What are friends for, if not to reconfigure a sorbet machine that turns people into flies into a sorbet machine that turns people into bees! Just remember, the effect wears off after a couple of hours. Why don't you come back for our inflatable wading pool party after your patch ceremony?
Isabella: Of course! Wouldn't miss it!
Phineas: See ya later, then!

Baljeet: Did you know that bees can communicate with each other through dancing?
Ginger: That's really interesting!
Baljeet: Yes. They do a tail-wagging dance to alert each other to a source of food. (in background) The waggle explains the angle to the destination in relations to the imaginary line between the sun and the door of the hive.
(While Baljeet is talking, Isabella takes the sorbet machine out of the box and pushes a button that turns it back into the control panel. She takes out a little green spiral notebook.)
Isabella: Okay, let's see...setting, targets... (she types in the control panel) "Fireside Girls..." And that should do it. (She presses a red button.) Here we go.

Poofenplotz: Mmmmwah. Much better. Now that my lips are taken care of, I can tell you about my beautifully evil plan. (Pinky growls, and Poofenplotz sprays him with a water bottle.) Bad doggie! Okay, sit! (Pinky sits) That's better. Now pay attention as the camera slowly moves closer and we cross-dissolve to my thoughts.
(Cross-dissolve to a beehive.)
Poofenplotz: (voiceover) Behold, a humble beehive. A massively warded society just like our own. Observe a young grub bee fed mass quantities of royal jelly, which will make her larger and eventually she will become queen. So logic dictates that if I were to consume massive amounts of royal jelly, then I would grow four times bigger and live four times longer and eventually be crowned Queen of the World! The Queen!
(Cross dissolve to Poofenplotz in a dark but lit area wearing a crown)
Poofenplotz: And I shall not be dark, but beautiful, like the night in the day, and all shall love me and despair!

Poofenplotz: (voiceover) And I might have a grotesquely large abdomen for laying eggs, but I can live with that.

Isabella: Wow! Humans really take for granted not being sucked into the nearest vacuum cleaner. I'm gonna see if the queen knows anything. (She buzzes up to the queen bee) Excuse me, Your Majesty, do you have any idea how to get out?
Queen Bee: Not a clue. And without my jelly, I'm way too weak to fly. Ugh.
Isabella: Whadaya think, Fireside Girls?
Holly: What are we supposed to do now?
Gretchen: Bee Day's almost over and we're stuck inside a pharmacist's power-vac.
Isabella: What? Over? Did you say "over"? Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when we helped Candace get fifty patches in one day? Heck no!
Holly: I thought it was only forty-nine.
Ginger: Forget it, she's rolling.
Isabella: And it's not over now! Cause when the going gets tough... the tough get going! Come on, girls, we've got enough patches between all of us to make this work! We can do this! Gretchen, Milly, Katie, you've got the exploring patch, right?
Milly: Yes, and we can look for a way back out of here!
Gretchen, Milly and Katie: Right!
Isabella: (picking up a piece of hair) These pieces of hair and dust are like rope! Holly, Ginger, you girls have the advanced knot-tying patch. What do you think?
Holly: We could totally work with that stuff!
Ginger: And make a sling for the queen!
Isabella: And Adyson, you and I have the appliance repair patch!
Adyson: Let's hotwire the vacuum and reverse the motor so that it blows us all out again!
Isabella: (fist bumping Adyson) That's what I'm talkin' about!
Adyson: There they are! All we need to do is swap those leads to the forward-reverse switch.
Isabella: Great! How's that sling comin'?
Gretchen, Milly and Katie: All good to go!
Isabella: Excellent work! Recon Team, is the escape path charted?
Ginger and Holly: Yes, ma'am! Power vac hose located!
Holly: (sneezes) Achoo! It was murder on my allergies.
Isabella: Bee-autiful! Prepare for exit, everyone!
(Cut to outside the vacuum. Perry throws his fedora. It hits both the forward/reverse switch and the on/off switch. Cut back to inside the vacuum as the bees get blown right out. The Aroma-inator gives Doofenshmirtz a huge spritzing, but he then sees the escaped bees)
Doofenshmirtz: Uh-oh! (All the bees surround Doofenshmirtz) Ah!
Isabella: Great job, Adyson!
Adyson: (sarcastically) Uh, thanks?
Isabella: We're going home to the Fireside Lodge! Everybody, follow me!
(Wide shot of D.E.I. as the myselfcopter flies past it.)
(Cut to the Fireside Lodge. The Fireside Bees are still leading the bees to the lodge, but suddenly, Isabella's right leg begins to grow.)
Isabella: Oh! It's wearing off!! (screams)
(Holly's left hand begins to grow, followed by Katie's right ear)
Isabella: Come on! We're almost there!
(Wide shot as all the Fireside Girls grow back to their normal size and land on the ground.)
Isabella: Yay! The bees are back! Now we just need to get them back into their hives.
Milly: Okay, little bees, go back into your hive.
Holly: We don't speak their language anymore. We can't communicate.
Katie: Ooh! I have my semaphore patch! Would that work?
Adyson: Only if they were on a boat.
Ginger: Baljeet is the answer.
Isabella: Ginger, now really isn't the time t—
Ginger: No no! He told me all about this dance they do to alert each other to a source of food or shelter.
Gretchen: Like the rhumba?
Ginger: No, it's a waggle dance!
Isabella: Dance patches we've got!

Poofenplotz: Ah, my locatificator has led me to the motherlode! The royal jelly room at the Moist Beauty Works factory! It won't be long now, Agent Pinky. Soon I'll be able to carry out my most beautifully evil plan yet! (she laughs again. Shot of a nervous Pinky from inside the makeup case. He sees a loose thread and pulls it making the bag come apart. Pinky pushes Poofenplotz making the myselfcopter crash land.) Bad doggy! Bad bad doggy! Oof! (Shot from inside the factory. Poofenplotz is flat on her face.) Ooh. That's the last time I buy a cheap designer knockoff trap from downtown. (gasps) I don't believe it! Fortune is smiling upon me like the creepy guy on the corner of 3rd and Main! (She gets up) We're in the royal jelly chamber of the Moist Beauty organic cosmetics factory! Ha ha ha! How unbelievably coincidental. No really, I mean, I couldn't have asked for a better place to crash. Anyway, you have failed, Pinky the Chihuahua, and brought me right to the biggest supply of royal jelly in the Tri-State Area! (She laughs evilly again as Pinky kicks her into the chambers, which pours royal jelly all over her) I....can't move. Well, I...I'm not much larger and I'm not really feeling royal at all. I suppose my plan was predicated on a faulty hypothesis now, wasn't it? I guess there's only one thing to say, and that's: Curse you, Pinky the Chihuahua!!
(Pinky jumps into the myselfcopter and flies out of the factory tying up Poofenplotz with it.)
Poofenplotz: Ooh, how humiliating. Piloted off to the pokey by a pooch.

Linda: Aw, it's just like old times.
Phineas: Hey, Isabella, we're having iced tea! You want some, honey?
Isabella: What did you say?
Phineas: I said, "We're having iced tea! (taking out a honey bear tube and a spoon) You want some honey?"
Isabella: (awkwardly) Oh, um, heh-heh, sure!
Candace: (In a dream) But, you honor, how could I have robbed that bank if I was already wearing the prison jumpsuit? It just doesn't make any-- (She wakes up to the sound of Buford humming) Somehow I want to finish that dream to find out if I'm guilty or not.

Candace: I'm just getting an early start on busting my brothers.
Buford: You know, you should really find a new hobby. You've got no skills.
Candace: Ha! I'd like to see you keep their contraptions from disappearing at the last second.

Over a bit more. That's right. (appears on a trading card) Hey-Oh. Carl installed a nano-screen on this trading card a few days ago, disguised as a Flynn-Fletcher family member.
Carl: (Dressed as Candace) Can you guess which one?
Monogram: Take that off already, Carl. You're creeping me out, man.
Carl: Okay...
Monogram: Sorry to wake you up so early Agent P, but evil never rests and by "evil" I mean Doofenshmirtz. It's not even 6 AM yet, and our surveillance cameras have spotted him at the local caffeination station, ordering the largest, most caffeinated beverage they sell. Nothing good can come from this hideous spurt of energy, so get to it Agent-- (Offscreen Phineas is talking to Ferb) Sounds like your boys are on their way back. Get to it Agent P.

Phineas: Way to floss, Ferb. Who knew fighting plaque could be so much fun? Come to think of it, (Entering his bedroom along with Ferb) I know what we're going to do today Ferb. Hey where's Perry? That's strange.
Ferb: I know we normally do this later in the day.
Phineas: Yes, yes we do. 
Candace: Sweet, with Buford as my busting stooge, now I can concentrate on more important things. (Candace turns on the TV)
TV Show: It's time for "Girls Freaking Out!"
Candace: Ooh, I love this show. It makes me feel so normal.
Linda: (She walks into the room) Okay Candace, I'm off to the beach. Vivian called and said the waves are crankin'. I have my cell with me.

(the ball causes a car to drive into a target, launching an anvil into a catcher's mitt, dropping a cage on Perry) Yeah, yeah, yeah... Yes! Ha! I win! I know it's a little over the top, but I was inspired by this board game I love when I was a kid. Well actually, it was Roger's board game. But I would sneak a peek of it, through the keyhole of his door. You know it looked like I would love it. But, I borderline backstory. (He takes a few short breathes) You see, I have so much evil energy from the soy venti latte extra-caf-and-a-half quadruple sugar, blood pressure bomberino. Love it! So I spent the whole morning building this complex, giant version of the game. Really I surprised you didn't see it flying in. Okay, beholding time! Behold my Luff-Flex-Dill-Pickle-inator! What does it do, you ask? (takes out a screen) Well it will launch all of my enemies into orbit, and keep them floating there so far into the atmosphere, that they won't bother me anymore. Cool, huh? Yeah I know the name's a little weird, but hey, I bought it off the internet, and my rights to it expire tomorrow, so I was kinda forced to use it today. I have so much energy from that one cup of coffee, I just keep rambling-- (Perry hops out of a hole in his cage) Ooh. you know that trap was always the lamest part of the game.

Irving: And I'll sell ballooths. (Isabella and Baljeet stare at Irving) Balloons in the shape of a tooth.
Baljeet: Oh, you mean toothalloons.
Isabella: Ballooths? Where'd you get ballooths from?
Buford: Yeah, that's toothalloons. And I'll lock it all down, and make sure it doesn't move.
Phineas: Alright, safety first, I guess. Knock yourself out.
Candace: (Looking out of her window) Let's see how the rookie's doing on his assignment. (Quirky Worky Song in the background) Hmm, not bad. I kinda like his style.
Irving: Toothalloons! Get your toothalloons here!

Phineas: Alright everybody, all aboard the tooth-buggies. Ferb even installed dental floss-themed seat belts.
Isabella: Mmm, minty.
Phineas and Isabella: Woo-hoo!

Candace: Not so fast! I knew too! You're giving up, and just going on the ride for fun.
Buford: Not hardly. I swiped this bad-boy (His rivet gun) from the orthodontist's section, to cut off stuff sticking out of the ride that could snag a passing plane as they go along.
Candace: Listen, this thing ain't snag on a plane is just the tip of the bicuspid. It could shrink down to the size of a real tooth, and get lost in the grass. Or turn to ice, and melt into nothingness. For all you know it could turn into a giant Ducky Momo, and fly away. Are you prepared for all that?

Irving: My toothalloons!
Buford: Yeah, they weren't selling anyway. Not on my watch. (Another beam hits the helium tank, and it floats away) Ah! The helium tank! Actually it's kinda ironic when you think about it.

(No response.) No? No no, I shoulda stuck with the first two, you're right. 
(Cut to downtown Danville. Candace is wandering around with the camera.)
Candace: Ooh, score! That awning is the same color as Jeremy's eyes! (snaps the photo) Aaaand...daffodils! Just like the ones he gave me on our third date! (Snaps the flower.) 
(Cut to the backyard. Phineas, Ferb and Isabella are by the computer receiving the pictures Candace took.)
Phineas: Incoming. Perfect! Same color as Jeremy's eyes! Huh, flower. I'm drawin' a blank.
Ferb: Daffodil, third date.
Phineas: Riiiight...Now the machine will take the images, and print them into giant scaled-up form.
(A printer prints out a flat daffodil, which folds itself into an oragami daffodil, and emits a scent.)
Buford: Nice touch! Smells like my grandma!
Phineas: I thought your grandma smelled like ant pheromones.
Buford: Naw, that's the other one.
Phineas: These should really make Jeremy's Birthday Scrapbook-aganza a full sensory experience!
Buford: (sarcastically) Great, just what I always wanted: to fully sense Jeremy. 
(Cut back to the florist.)
Candace: Okay, what else? Ah! (She walks up to a couple drinking outside a French café. She takes the man's mug.) 'Scuse. Hot cocoa! (Snaps the mug and sips.) Not bad, although Jeremy prefers it with a little more cinnamon. (Walks away.) I gotta make a note of that for the boys.
Man: I guess my fortune came true. "You will share your cocoa with a long-necked teenager." See? Right there.
Woman: Mine just says, "Your boyfriend's gonna get a fortune cookie at a French café." 
(Cut back to D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Get ready, Perry the Platypus! The Tri-State Area's about to confront its fears! (Evil laughter from Doof. Another business card with mechanical arms and legs slips through the rope and crawls up to Perry's tail. A laser beam shoots through the robot and burns the rope down, freeing Perry. He kicks Doof.) Aaah! Ow ow! I landed on my jawbone, right under that weird...sticky-outy part under your ear! And my jawbone landed on the remote. Ah, Doof. (The inator activates and shoots Doof.) Okay, nothing bad will happen as long as I don't think about anything scary or... (A pounding on the door is heard.) Oh no! I couldn't help it, it just popped in there! It can't be! (The door breaks down revealing evil vending machine robots.) Vending machines are taking over! I said it could happen! No! Stay back! Stay back! Back! Flee! Flee! (Doof attempts to escape, but the vending machines grab hold of him.) No no no! I'm not really hungry! Really! (Stutters) No no, not the tiny vanilla cookies! How long have those been in there?! (The machines force feed Doof a packet of vanilla cookies.) 
(Cut to the backyard. Candace walks up with a hard hat and a clipboard.)
Phineas: Hey, Candace, the scrapbook-aganza is complete! Plus, we got Love Händel to come in for a live soundtrack!
(Whip pan right to reveal the band.)
Danny: Okay, guys, performance level! (Strums the intro)
Candace: I'm gonna need a test run so I can make notes.
Phineas: Sure. You're the boss.
Candace: That's right.
(Candace walks up to the gondola, which activates.)

Phineas: That sounded great guys, but it's a B-natural in the chorus!
Danny: Toldja!
Bobbi: That's what I was playing! 
(Cut back to D.E.I. Perry is walking out leaving Doof with his fear.)
Doofenshmirtz: (offscreen) No! No! Not that! Anything but the fake red licorice! It tastes like... (Doof grunts. Perry stops walking and figures he has to save Doof.) No! What possessed me to make such a horrifying inator?! (Perry jumps on the DVDs and hops onto the inator aiming it. He lands on the floor and hits the remote. The inator hits the vending machines. A giant nickel rolls by and the machines run for their lives.) Well, I guess now we know what scares vending machines. 
(Cut back to the backyard.)
Phineas: Well, Candace, do you think Jeremy will like it?
Candace: (seriously) Yeah, I just have a few notes here. (Excitedly, as she reveals she drew a smiley face on the clipboard.) It's perfect! (gasps) I love it, guys! Iloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveit...
Phineas: (to Ferb) She had me at "smiley face". 
(Cut back to Doof and Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus, you're back! (walking up to the inator) I am never setting that puppy off again. (He presses a button, and, as usual, the inator activates and aims across town.) Oops. 
(Cut back to Candace.)
Candace: It's really perfect! (The beam hits Candace.) I'm glad Mom's gone for the day 'cause my biggest fear is that this is just gonna fly away before Jeremy gets here. (car horn honks, Candace gasps) And there he is! (runs off) Woohoo!
Baljeet: Uh, did anyone else see that weird green beam?
Buford: I wasn't gonna mention it.
(Cut to the gate. Candace runs out.)
Candace: Jeremy!! Jeremy Jeremy Jeremy Jeremy Jeremy!!! You gotta see what the boys built in the backyard!!! (drags him)
(Cut to the backyard as the Scrapbook-aganza flies away like Candace predicted.)
Candace: (runs up) No no! No no!! It's gone! My worst fear has come true! I totally blew it!
Jeremy: Let me guess, you had your brothers build me something super cool for my birthday and now it disappeared. It's okay, I get it.
Phineas: We don't have the invention anymore, but here's what we used as a blueprint. Candace designed it herself.
(Phineas gives Jeremy the scrapbook, which he opens on the page showing their first kiss.)

Doofenshmirtz: Oops. I really meant to hit the self-destruct button. I'll just get this for you. (Kaboom!) So, uh, you need your parking validated or, uh... Oh, oh, you found a spot on the street! Huh! Lucky you! Curse you, Perry the Platypus and all that! You know. 
(Cut back to the backyard.)
Phineas: Isabella, you've been awfully quiet all day.
(Song: Watchin' and Waitin' (instrumental))
Isabella: (looks at her watch) I have just earned my 24 Hours of Silence Patch! I can see why you don't talk much, Ferb. I actually quite enjoyed it. I ended up having an inner dialogue with myself all day.
Ferb: Welcome to Ferbland.
(Zoom in on Ferb's brain.)
Ferb head #1: Yes, the universe is constantly expanding.
Ferb head #2: But what is it expanding into?
Ferb heads: Ooooooh...
Ferb head #3: Okay, now my mind is blown.
(Scene opens up at D.E.I with Doofenshmirtz yelling in his dream.)
Doofenshmirtz: No, No, No! I've been good! Don't put me in your gundersack! Not the gundersack! Ahhhhhhhhh! The Kinderlumper!
(Doofenshmirtz sits up in bed, breathing heavily, then gasps.)
Doofenshmirtz: That's it! Der Kinderlumper!
(Doofenshmirtz chuckles evilly as he comes to a evil realization.) 
(Scene shifts to the the Flynn-Fletcher house.)
Candace: So, what do you think?
Stacy: I think you look like you just fell off a turnip truck, and then got run over by a rutabaga truck.
Candace: Yeah yeah, real funny. This is the official rutabaga regalia for the 100th Running of the Chinchillas from Danville to Badger Town. By wearing this it will entice the chinchillas to follow me the Princess!
Stacy: So yeah, I get it. It's a huge honor and everything. But come on Candace, why do you really want to be Rutabaga Princess?
Candace: I get to start the Running of the Chinchillas!
Stacy: Yeah...
Candace: Mom, Dad, and everyone in Danville will be waiting in Badger Town to see me cross the finish line!
Stacy: Yeah...
Candace: I get to be on TV!
Stacy: That's the reason!
Candace: Stacy, this is my first step on my way to stardom and as my best friend, you'll be famous by association.
Stacy: That's my favorite kind of famous!
Phineas: (Off-screen.) Candace!
Candace: What is it, Phineas?
Phineas: Look at the cool vehicles we made for you for the Running of the Chinchillas! Baljeet has grown a new super street of bio engineer rutabaga!
Baljeet: I simply spliced the genetic code of a rutabaga and a giant redwood.
Buford: Aaaaannnnd?
Baljeet: And fennel.
Buford: I want it to smell like licorice!
Candace: You're not getting me into one of those things! I'm not showin' up for my TV debut lookin' like a complete weirdo! (to Stacy) What? I said, "Complete". (to the gang) And now, I must leave. My public awaits.
Stacy: Yeah, and I must go be famous by association.
Phineas: And to think, we knew Stacy before she was famous by association.

♪ Doo bee doo bee doo— ♪
(Linda walks in vacuuming)
Linda: Dah! I'm supposed to be in Badgertown! (she runs off leaving the still-on vacuum behind her. We hear an inexplicable cat scream in the background.) 
(Cut to Agent P's lair. Monogram is on screen with a Chinchilla racing forum in one and a pen in the other. Perry approaches the screen.)
Major Monogram: Morning, Agent P. I was just doing a little handicapping for this year's Running of the Chinchillas. Think I'm going to box Dryer's Dust with Squeaky Toy.
Carl: (also holding a racing forum and a pen) And I'm taking Gerbil Bait to win.
Major Monogram: You're daft, Carl! (to Perry) Anyway, rumor has it that Doofenshmirtz plans to attend the ceremony. Odds are he's up to something evil. Better look into it, Agent P. (Perry zips away) Hmmm...Gerbil Bait. Heh, talk about your long shots. (He looks to his right) Dangit, Carl! 
(Cut to an open field where a news reporter and a cameraman are on the scene)
Reporter: Good morning, everyone. I'm Mike van Hatofapilgrim here in Danville for the 100th Annual Running of the Chinchillas, (walking up to Candace and Stacy) and with us today is this year's Rutabaga Princess. And what's your name, young lady?
Candace: I'm Candace Flynn.
Stacy: (pushing Candace aside) And I'm famous by association!
Mike: That's great. (to the camera) Well, there ya have it. A good day for rutabagas, chinchillas, and self-promoting sycophantism. 
(Cut to a stage. Candace is standing behind a microphone and in front of a dozen or so chinchillas.)
Candace: Ahem. Citizens of Danville, it is now time for your princess....me....to start the Running of the Chinchillas! I now summon my tuber troubadour!
(Irving approaches Candace wearing a shirt that says "I Heart Rutabagas" carrying a bugle.)
Irving: I will now play the traditional chinchilla fanfare. (He takes a deep breath and plays a very out of tune fanfare. He inhales again, while Candace swipes the horn away revealing he's simply musically exhaling.) What? But—Huh? (Candace throws the horn away.) I see. Not a music lover. (He holds up a purple pillow with a rutabaga on it) My Princess?
Candace: I will now take a bite of the ceremonial rutabaga. (She sinks her teeth into the rutabaga, but then promptly spits it into her other hand.)
Irving: And now I most humbly take my leave. (He leaves) Princess.
Candace: Yeah, you do that, Sputnik. Chinchillas, let the running begin!
(And they're off!)
Mike: Well, there they go! And now, the Running of the Chinchillas is underway! And now, back to you in the studio.
Cameraman: There's no one in the studio. It's Sunday.
Mike: Really? How'm I supposed to do a live broadcast when no one is in the studio?
Cameraman: We're not live. We're taping this.
Mike: (sighs) Fine. 
(Cut to Candace who is running among the chinchillas. Stacy catches up to her.)
Stacy: Candace, here, let me get your train. (Holds onto Candace's cape, then hears a loud squeak) Oh, omigosh, sorry!
Candace: I don't know, Stacy. This is harder than I thought. (another loud squeak) Oh, sorry!
Stacy: Maybe if we ran in front of them, it would be a little easier.
Candace: Okay, now onward to Badgertown!
Stacy: Oh, omigosh, sorry! 
(Cut to D. E. I. Close up on Perry who is scaling up the building with suction cups. He takes off his hat and produces from it another black hole. Cut to inside Doofenshmirtz's lab, who is in his long johns tinkering with his latest inator.)
Doofenshmirtz: That should do it. (Perry emerges from the black hole while Doof's butt flap goes down.) Excellent. (turns around) Perry the Platypus? (looks at his butt flap) Oh. (he buttons it) Sorry you had to see that. It's just that...this one button. Anyway, you are just in time to witness as I activate the Kinderlumperinator and transform myself into a real live Kinderlumper! (Perry looks at Doofenshmirtz confused) What? Don't tell me you've never heard of the Kinderlumper. (Perry simply shrugs) Y'know...uh...gigantic troll with sharp teeth and nose like a broom handle, he grabs children, puts 'em in a gundersack if they...You never heard of this? My mother used to sing me this lovely song about it right before I went to bed. And it goes a little something like this. (He claps his hands twice. The lights go out. He claps twice again to reveal he is now dressed like Cab Calloway in front of a jazz band and does some of Cabby's signature walks.)

(Doofenshmirtz claps twice turning off the lights. He claps twice again turning them back on to reveal himself and Perry back where they were at the end of their conversation)
Doofenshmirtz: So anyway, I got this actual-sized Kinderlumper costume (climbing inside the suit) and I'm gonna shoot myself with the Kinderlumperinator to make me gigantic and trollish so, ya know, it will fit. Then I will go to scare my brother, Roger, so badly that he is certain to relinquish control of the Tri-State Area to me! Well, to the Kinderlumper, actually, but when the ray wears off, I'll be me again and I'll already be in control. Stand back, Perry the Platypus. Prepare to do some beholding! (He claps twice again, activating the Kinderlumperinator. Perry jumps up to him) Oh! Knock it off, you crazy platy— (The inator zaps both of them, transforming Doofenshmirtz into an exact likeness of the Kinderlumper, while Perry transforms into a rather giant hairy bearded platypus-type monster) It worked! Hee hee hee hee hee hee! (He claps twice accidentally activating the inator again, which shoots through the black hole and out the building.) 
(Cut back to Candace and Stacy running in front of the chinchillas)
Candace: Y'know, Stacy? This is fun. I could get used to this princess thing. (The blue ray zaps all of the chinchillas making them into giant beasts. Stacy screams first followed by Candace. They flee past a news van. The chinchilla beasts follow them, tipping the van over. Mike and the cameraman open the doors and emerge from the van.)
Mike: Did you see that? Call in Chopper 4! This is the biggest story of my career! (He jumps out of the van) Let's get some!
Cameraman: Oh, why did I ever opt for work release? 
(Cut back to D.E.I. where the giant Perry monster is stomping on the inator)
Doofenshmirtz: Seriously, Perry the Platypus, is it really necessary to destroy everything? (Perry jumps off the destroyed inator and chatters. Doofenshmirtz backs away leading Perry onto a giant black "X" in the middle of the room) N-nn-n-n-now, now, that's a good trollish gigantic platypus. (Doofenshmirtz claps twice activating a giant cage that drops on Perry) Ha! Let that be a lesson to you: Never stand on a big cartoony "X"! And now, I've a little appointment to keep with the mayor. (Doof exits laughing. Perry chatters) 
(Cut back to the Flynn-Fletcher house. The gang are standing in front of the rutabaga vehicles)
Phineas: Everyone have your signs and foam fingers ready to cheer Candace on?
Baljeet: (showing his foam finger) Ready!
Buford: (showing he ripped his finger) Ready!
Baljeet: Buford, you ripped your finger off.
Buford: (threateningly) Yeah! What about it?!
Baljeet: Nothing.
Candace: (offscreen) Phineas Phineas Phineas...and Ferb! (she and Stacy run into the frame) You have to help us! We're being chased by monster-sized chinchillas!
Phineas: Monster-sized chinchillas? That's awesome!
Candace: Here they come!
(The chinchilla beasts stampede down the street. Cut to a news chopper where Mike and the cameraman are riding)
Mike: This is amazing! I've never been in a helicopter before!
(The cameraman sighs.) 
(Cut to Candace, Stacy and the gang all in separate rutabaga vehicles. Isabella, meanwhile, is sprinting on rutabaga spring-shoes.)
Stacy: They're gaining on us!
(The beasts all follow the vehicles)
Stacy: And can't this thing go any faster!
Candace: I got the fennel pedal all the way to the rutabaga metal! And yes, I know it's a weird sentence.
(Buford and Baljeet yell as the beasts trample past them. Cut to Isabella on her shoes)
Isabella: Phineas! (She screams as she gets taken in by the beasts)
Phineas: Isabella!!!! Noooooooooo!!!!! (Too late as Phineas and Ferb become the last victims)
Stacy: Oh no! Phineas and Ferb!!
Mike: (from the chopper) Oh, those poor innocent kids. (covering his eyes) I can't watch. It's just-It's just—I'm gonna step outside where I can—WOOOOOOAHH! Did you see that?! I almost stepped out of the helicopter! Did you just see that?!
(Cut back to Candace and Stacy screaming as their vehicle crashes into a hydrant. Stacy's foot gets caught under the vehicle.)
Stacy: Save yourself, princess! RUN!!! RUN!!!! AAAHHHHH!!!!
(Overhead shot of Danville as Candace runs from the beasts, the news chopper following them) 
(Cut to the finish line in Badgertown where there is a big stage placed with lots of people gathered around it. Roger and Melanie are standing on the stage)
Melanie: The chinchillas should be here any minute, Mr. Mayor.
Roger: I hope they don't ask me to eat any rutabagas like last year.
Melanie: I think we can avoid (gasps dramatically) WHAT IS THAT?!?!
(Cut to reveal Doofenshmirtz, still in Kinderlumper form, trodding down the road.)
Roger: I think I know this guy. There's nothing to be afraid of! It's only the Kinderlumper come to join our celebration! Ha-ha! Now it's a party!
Doofenshmirtz: I, uh, I believe the more appropriate response would be to flee in terror.
Roger: But, Kinderlumper, why would I ever run away from you?
Doofenshmirtz: Don't you remember the Kinderlumper song?
Roger: Remember? Of course I remember! Bubbe used to sing me the song every night.
♪ The Kinderlumper's always going to love you ♪
♪ And bring you lots of presents while you sleep. ♪
Doofenshmirtz: N-n-no, wait! Those are not the words!!!
Roger: Well, that's how she sang it to me. And I still have some of the gifts you brought me. (He takes out a box of almond brittle.) Look! Almond brittle!
Doofenshmirtz: NO!!! But—But you don't even like almond brittle!
Roger: I know. (puts the box back in his jacket) That's why I never ate it.
Doofenshmirtz: (sobbing) Nooo-ho-ho....It's not fair!
Roger: Funny. I never thought of the Kinderlumper as such a crybaby.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh no! The effects are wearing off! (Doofenshmirtz reverts back to his original self) 
(Cut to the Perry monster in the trap as he also returns to normal) 
(Cut back to Candace still being chased by the chinchilla beasts screaming.)
Candace: Run for your lives!
(The crowd screams as they see the beasts, who suddenly shrink back down to their small size.)
(Cut to the finish line as Linda and Lawrence are waiting.)
Candace: They're coming! The chinchillas! It's too late for me! (dropping in front of her parents) Save yourselves!
(Cut to Candace on the ground as the chinchillas run on top of her. Candace laughs as they tickle her.)
Lawrence: Were you this dramatic when you were Rutabaga Princess?
Linda: Oh, yeah.
Candace: Stop it! (giggling) Seriously!
(Cut to Stacy, Isabella, Baljeet, Buford, Phineas and Ferb, all carrying chinchillas and running to the finish)
Phineas: Candace, that was so exciting! You're the best Rutabaga Princess yet!
Candace: Phineas! I thought you were stampeded!
Phineas: We were! It didn't hurt. They were big but they were still fluffy.
Ferb: It's like being run over by cotton candy. But less sticky.
Mike: That was amazing! We got it all on camera!
Candace: Wait, really? Did you get Phineas and Ferb and the rutabaga vehicles?
Mike: Eeyup. The whole thing!
Candace: Where's the camera?
Mike: (pointing offscreeen) Oh, it's right over there. 
(Cut to the chopper, which is now infested with all the chinchillas. They somehow fly off with the camera still inside.)
Mike: NO!!! The biggest story of my career (sobbing) and it just flew away!
Candace: Welcome to my world, Mike. Welcome to my world.
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry. (picks him up) Get over here, you hairy little beast! (Perry chatters) 
(Scene opens up on Danville High School)
Becky: Hey, Vanessa! How was your summer?
Vanessa: Oh, the basic. Pretty cool when I was at my mom's and okay when I was at my dad's. Did you know in July, he actually removed all the blue from all the paintings at the museum? All the blue!
Lacie: Omigosh, I totally saw that! Picasso's whole Blue Period is just beige now.
Vanessa: Yep. That was my dad.

Johnny: Sigh.
Vanessa: Hi, Johnny.
Lacie: It looks like he didn't take your breaking up very well.
Johnny: (offscreen) Sigh.
Vanessa: It wasn't like we were going out that long, Johnny!
Johnny: Just take the dissection tray and use its wax foundation to cradle my broken heart, Vanessa!
Male Student 1: Let it go, bro.
Vanessa: And to think I wanted to come back to school for a sense of normalcy.

Principal Lang: Dr. Doofenshmirtz is here on a trial basis.
Doofenshmirtz: Yeah, no, we already had the trial. The judge gave me a choice of doing hard time or community service. So, here I am, ready to impart upon these young, sponge-like minds all my vast knowledge of evil sci—I-I mean science. That's right. Regular old science. No evil at all. In fact, I've crossed out the word "Evil" whenever it appears in my old textbooks. So, this should be a piece of cake. (to Vanessa) Hi, sweetie-kins! (Vanessa slams her head on her desk.) Thank you, Principal Lang. I can take it from here.
Principal Lang: Just so you know, Heinz, I've got my eye on you. I miss nothing.
(He backs into door and ends up in the janitor's closet. He gets back up and walks backwards out the correct door.)
Doofenshmirtz: And nice to see you, too! (to the class) Y'know, we knew each other long ago, but that's a story for another time. I'm Dr. Doofenshmirtz. (writing on the blackboard) D-O-O-F-E...

Vanessa: No! No special treatment, because this is not happening!

Mrs. Pierpoint: Principal Lang, are you brooding again?
Principal Lang: Why does everyone always think I'm brooding? It's my brow, isn't it?
Mrs. Pierpoint: Well...
Principal Lang: Yes, I'm brooding! It's that Heinz Doofenshmirtz! We went to community college together.
Mrs. Pierpoint: Oh.
Principal Lang: He wound up marrying Charlene, the girl that I was in love with!
Mrs. Pierpoint: Aren't they divorced now?
Principal Lang: That's not the point!
Mrs. Pierpoint: Oh, I'm sorry.

Principal Lang: Give up a grudge? Never! What do you think this brow is for?

Now, all of the information that makes this young man who and what he is stored in these DNA strands in every cell of his body. The-The genetic code is very delicate. See, now, if we move this base pair over to here, he would have been a gorilla, or you know, maybe a lizard. Y'see, there's this whole world of things going on, too small for us to even notice.
(Pan down to reveal a small purple insect standing next to a yellow insect.)
Yellow insect: So, what are we doing here again, Napoleon?
Napoleon: (the purple insect) Well, Wendell, we're going to make contact with these magnificent giants!
Wendell: We will?
Napoleon: Yes, we will.
Wendell: Wait. Why will we?
Napoleon: To be the first ones to communicate with an alien race. Just think, Wendell, you and I and Floyd are going to go where no bug has gone be— Okay, where's Floyd? Floyd!
(A sickly green fly saunters up to the other two.)
Floyd: Sorry, sir. Ran into a spider web. Lost my wings.
Napoleon: They're behind you, Floyd.
(Floyd looks behind him.)
Floyd: I found 'em, sir.
Napoleon: So as I was saying—
Floyd: They were behind me.
Napoleon: Yes, we've established that. Continuing, we are going to make contact with the giants! But first, we must scale the Cliffs of Mahogany! (referring to the desk) This may take a few tries, but—
Wendell: Sir, let me throw it! I'm the muscle!
Napoleon: You're the muscle?
Wendell: Yes! You're the brains, I'm the muscle, and Floyd is...
Napoleon: Floyd is the ballast?
Wendell: Yes! Floyd is the ballast!
Floyd: Ooh, that sounds important.
Napoleon: Anyway, Wendell, if you're feeling muscular, be my guest.
Wendell: Stand back! (He swings the grappling hook, which is actually a string with a bent paper clip on it. The clip latches onto a beaker. The beaker tips off the desk and traps the bugs.)
Napoleon: Hmm. Well, we have a limited air supply. Floyd, stop breathing. 
(Cut to the desk. Three books hit a balance, which flips up a petrie dish containing two electric needles on a string. One pin latches onto a frog and the other onto one potato on a potato powered clock. The frog becomes alive and kicks the petrie dish off the microscope. Doof watches as the dish hits Johnny's face.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, that's unfortunate. (takes the dish off) Uh, hopefully, the DNA in the petrie dish won't combine with... (Johnny starts growing a lizard tail) Oh! Oh! No, see, it's... It's happening already.
Johnny: (looks behind him) Uh... (begins transforming and howls like a gorilla. His right arm becomes a gorilla arm.)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, so everyone pay attention to this. This is what I was talking about. The DNA of a human is only a few base pairs from that of a monkey. (Johnny's left arm becomes a lizard's arm.) Or... or a reptile for that matter.
Johnny: (growls and runs away)
Doofenshmirtz: See? I told you. A whiner. 
(Cut to the hallway. The deformed lizard-gorilla-teen is running down.)
Johnny: What is happening?!
(Close up on a security camera.) 
(Cut to OWCA headquarters where Carl and Monogram are watching Johnny run.)
Carl: Uh, sir? I think you should take a look at this.
Major Monogram: Great googly moogly! I was afraid it might come to this.
(Cut to Perry sleeping in the backyard. His wristwatch beeps.)
Perry: (chatters tiredly)
Major Monogram: Agent P, pick up! (turns over sleepily and scratches his rear) Agent P, please pick up! (Perry finally picks up) Ah! So sorry, Agent P, I... I know that this is your time to enjoy some well-deserved rest, but something's gone wrong in Doof's class, and, well, the OWCA work-release program doesn't need this kind of scandal. Whadaya say, P?
(Perry puts on his fedora, goes into the tree and into his hovercar.)
♪ Doo bee doo bee doo bah ♪
♪ Doo bee doo bee doo bah ♪
♪ Scary teenage monster ♪ 
(Cut to Becky at the door.)
Becky: Guys, Johnny's running wild out there!
Doofenshmirtz: Aha!
Vanessa: Dad, what are you doing?
Doofenshmirtz: It's one of Johnny's hairs. It's loaded with his DNA. With this, I can mix up an antidote to...
(Dramatic sting. Cut to Agent P at the door.)
Gideon: (offscreen) He shapeshifted again!
Doofenshmirtz: No no. This isn't Johnny. It's, uh... (whispering) Perry the Platypus, I'm glad you're here. Could you go find Johnny and bring him back to the classroom? He's got greasy hair and he's wearing a trench coat. Mmm, and he's also part-gorilla, part-lizard. You can't miss him. (out loud) Class, Mr. Platypus is the...occasional assistant teacher.
Male Student 2: Is that a real platypus?
Doofenshmirtz: No! It's a.... it's a man. It's a deformed, tiny...turquoise man. Vanessa, take some of your friends here, uh, uh, Ponytails, Spikey Head, Tweedle-Tie and go get Johnny.
Vanessa: Hi, "Mr. Platypus".
(They leave.)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, and the rest of you, Muscles, Ropey-Face, Slap-Happy, Buzzy-Pants, stay here and help me with the antidote.
Ropey-Face: Wait, why am I Ropey-Face?
Doofenshmirtz: Take my advice: Own it. 
(Cut to Johnny still running down the halls. He goes into the gym.)
Vanessa: Johnny? Er, "Creature formerly known as Johnny"?
Johnny: (hiding under the bleachers) Go away!
Vanessa: Johnny, you've gotta come out! My dad can help you!
Johnny: You hate me!
Vanessa: I don't hate you. We can be friends.
Johnny: (sees Perry) Huh? Whoa! What is that thing?!
Vanessa: He's just a tiny turqouise m— AAAAH!! (Johnny carries Vanessa off like Fay Wray.)
Johnny: Vanessa!
Vanessa: Perry!!
(Perry shoots a net at Johnny and it latches onto his tail. Johnny escapes the premises with Vanessa in tow. The rest of the students follow Perry out.) 
(Cut to the garbage can where the three insects are sitting.)
Napoleon: Expedition journal, entry three. We have bivouacked on a landing halfway up the cliffs.
Wendell: I don't remember bivouacking.
Floyd: I went before we left.
Napoleon: Oy. Bivouac. It's a makeshift camp. That—Look, it's not important. What I'm worried about is, what are we going to tell the giants about ourselves?
Wendell: Floyd throws up on his food.
Floyd: It's true. I do.
Napoleon: Let's not lead with that.
Floyd: I can also smell through my hair.
Napoleon: But what do we say to an alien species to make them understand our entire culture? Our very place in this vast cosmos?
(Zoom out. One of the students opens the garbage can to throw out something and the bugs fall off and end up on the ring of the rope on the Periodic Table screen.)
Napoleon: What is happening?!
(They fly off the ring and bump into the model of the solar system and end up splatting on the ground.)
Floyd: I think I just bivouacked again. 
(Cut to Doof instructing Becky holding a dropper over a beaker carrying a liquid formula of some sort.)
Doofenshmirtz: Careful. Careful. Everything depends on getting the mixture precise. (Becky drops the liquid into the beaker. Doof stirs it with a straw and drinks it.) Mmm. Excellent. Now that's how you make a Shirley Temple. Hey, Muscles, how's the antidote coming?
Muscles: (wearing a hazmat suit and carrying a radioactive stick) Al...most... done. (drops it into the graduated cylinder and it explodes a bit. He pours it into the petri dish and Doof gets some of it with a needle.)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, we're all set. Now, where's whiny reptile boy?
Vanessa: (offscreen) Somebody help me!
(Cut to Johnny carrying Vanessa up the clock tower.)
Doofenshmirtz: (offscreen) He has Vanessa! (to the rest of the class) Who's up for a field trip? 
(Cut to outside Perry leads the class out.)
Johnny: Sanctuary!
Vanessa: Oh, you're such a drama queen. See, this... This is why we broke up!
(Cut to below. Perry takes off.)
Ropey-Face: Wait, where's he going?
(Doof makes his way through the crowd with the needle.)
Doofenshmirtz: Alright, now, how're we gonna... Nobody has a crossbow, do they?
Becky: I do! (beat) What? Why, is that weird?
(Doof takes the crossbow and Perry comes down in his hovercar.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, great! Thanks! (climbs in) Hey, you got new cup holders.
Ropey-Face: Whoa! Mr. Platypus has a cool ride!
Doofenshmirtz: Hang on, sweetie! (to Perry) Well, I guess it's just like the old saying, "You turn a guy into a gorilla-lizard, and he carries your daughter up a bell tower." It never really made sense to me before, but now I guess I... (Johnny pushes a bell off and it lands on Perry with a long DONG!) 
(Cut to Principal Lang feeding some fish and looking at his watch.)
Principal Lang: It is not one o'clock! 
(Whip pan to John P. Tristate Elementary. We hear the standard opening guitar riff.)
Sally: Hey, guys! How's it coming? Recess is almost over!
(Cut to reveal Phineas and Ferb modifying their playground.)
Phineas: Almost done!
(People scream offscreen.)
Phineas: (pointing) Ferb, look!
Vanessa: Johnny, put me down!
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, would you just stand still?! I can't get a clear shot!
Phineas: Aw man! I can't wait 'til we get to high school! It looks like so much fun! 
(Cut back to Perry's hovercar. Doof gets the bell off of Perry's head.)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus, hold still! I'll get it—
Vanessa: Dad, do something!
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, yes, yes! Hold on a second! (He attempts to fire the crossbow, but he and the bell topple off of the hovercar.)
Vanessa: Dad!!
(The bell lands in the ground and Doof lands in the bell. The bell leans over and the crossbow fires. Vanessa catches the needle and sticks it in Johnny's lizard arm. He starts to transform back, but drops Vanessa. Perry comes to her rescue. Johnny fully goes back to normal but falls off the tower. Vanessa jumps out of the hovercar and saves Johnny, and the net that is still attached to Johnny latches onto the hovercar. The students cheer from below. Perry drops them off and the students catch Johnny and Vanessa.)
Johnny: Vanessa, you saved my life!
Vanessa: Oh, please don't read anything into this.
Johnny: There's still hope!!!
Vanessa: What did I just say?!
Doofenshmirtz: Alright, everyone, back to class. Nothing to see here. Just a giant bell.
(Principal Lang comes out and sees the bell on the ground.)
Principal Lang: What in the bell? 
(Cut to the insects now on the desk.)
Napoleon: We've done it! We've reached the summit! Unfurl the banner, boys, and follow me! This is it! My entire existence has been leading to this moment, so that I can say... "Weclom Ginats!" (realizes what the banner says) Wait, what? "Weclom Ginats?!"
Wendell: What does that mean?
Napoleon: Exactly my point. What does our "Welcome Giants" banner actually say?
Wendell: Oh, yeah, sorry, we spelled it phonetically.
Napoleon: NO YOU DIDN'T!!!! Phonetically, it spells, "Weclom Ginats!" Come on, guys! This is our only chance to make a good first imp—
(Doof's Evil Science book squishes the bugs. Zoom out to the class.)
Doofenshmirtz: And that, class, is DNA in action.
Principal Lang: (bursting through the door) Aha!
(The school bell rings.)
Doofenshmirtz: That's it for today. Class dismissed.
(The students walk out chattering.)
Doofenshmirtz: Bye-bye, now.
Vanessa: (walking up to her father) Dad? (sighs) So, you're my teacher now.
Doofenshmirtz: I'm your teacher now.
Vanessa: But, we're not gonna do...all of..."this"...every day, right?
Doofenshmirtz: I'll try. But you know, (to the tune of the Theme song) ♪ there's 261 days 'til next summer vacation ♪, and, you know, a lot can happen. Just saying.
(Zoom in on the Evil Science book. Napoleon comes out from under it.)
Napoleon: Ugh. I do believe I've fractured my exoskeleton.
Wendell: And I bivouacked! 
(Open on the Flynn-Fletcher house at night decorated for Halloween. Cut to inside where Lawrence, dressed in a gorilla suit, is carving a jack-o-lantern. His sons approach him.)
Phineas: Wow! Looks great, Dad!
Lawrence: Thank you, boys.
Phineas: Come on, Ferb! We have work to do!
Candace: (walking in the background carrying her costume) Nice costume, Dad! See ya after the party!
Lawrence: Oh, yes, you have fun at the castle party tonight. (putting the mask on his head) If you need anything, your mother and I will be here scaring the sugar out of the little trick or treaters.
(Linda comes in dressed as a nurse.)
Linda: Well, how do I look, dear? (Lawrence makes gorilla sounds and bangs his hands on his chest.) Oh, no, a gorilla! 
(Cut to the backyard. Agent P puts on his fedora and jumps into a pile of leaves. A leaf blower makes the leaves disappear and we don't see Perry. Cut to Perry's lair, all decorated for Halloween. Major Monogram is onscreen dressed as screen legend Carmen Miranda.)
Major Monogram: Okay, Agent P, who do I look like? Huh, whadaya think? (Perry simply stares) C'mon! Carmen Miranda! Y'know, you really should watch more old movies.
Carl: (entering, also dressed as Carmen Miranda) Sir, I found your dosimeter. It was—What are you doing?!
Major Monogram: Great googly moogly! Is that what I look like?! Wow, suddenly I feel ridiculous. Nevermind, Carl, you can have it.
Carl: (exiting) Sheesh.
Major Monogram: Moving right along: Sorry you have to work on Halloween, but just get out there and see what Doof has planned. I'd give you more information, but, obviously, I've got to find a new costume. Thanks a lot, Carl! 
(Cut to Vanessa on the phone with Monty.)
Monty: (on phone) Well, hello, Vanessa.
Vanessa: Hey, Monty, what are you up to?
(Split screen to Monty at a black tie event.)
Monty: I'm just doing a little freelance for my dad. What's up?
Vanessa: I happen to be throwing the biggest, baddest, Halloweeniest bash ever! It's tonight and I think you should come.
Monty: A costume party? Hey, that means we can actually be seen in public together and no one will know.
Vanessa: That's the plan! I'm checking out my Queen of the Vampires costume even as we speak.
Monty: Oooh...
Vanessa: It's pretty cute.
Monty: Great, I'll be there! I'll be dressed as the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Vanessa: The Scarlet what?
Monty: You know, he wears a big red hat with a feather in it. You should watch more old movies.
Vanessa: Well, you know, it's a little known fact that vampire queens love Pumpernels.
Monty: Pimpernel.
Vanessa: Yeah, whatever, OWCA boy.
Monty: See ya tonight.
(They hang up. The split screen widens to reveal Monty standing next to Agent M.)
Monty: Sorry, Agent M. You're on your own from here on out.
Agent M: Ohhhh.... 
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz's apartment. The doorbell plays the Evil Jingle. Doofenshmirtz approaches the door.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, goody, trick or treaters.
Trick or Treaters: Trick or treat!
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, lessee, what do we have here? Class dunce with a fake scar, and you must be the Princess of Meatland...and...uh, oh, uh, Upset Rooster Head. And what are you supposed to be, a kid in a sheet? (The "kid in the sheet" takes off the sheet to reveal:) A platypus in a sheet? (He puts on the fedora) Perry the Platypus in a sheet?! Do I -- well, uh, that's perfect! Wait, wait, I was hoping you would— (Perry twists Doofenshmirtz's arm) Ow!! Whoa whoa whoa whoa, I'm being sincere! There's no trap, no inator, just come over here, you gotta see this. It was delivered today. (They walk to the balcony to reveal a castle turret outside.) I had to sign for it and everything! (Cut to outside to reveal a rather ancient castle next to the D.E.I. building.) It's a real castle with...with a moat! Who delivers a moat?! How'd they even get that on the plane? It's from my Great Aunt Henrietta Hawkenschpit. She left it to me in her will. L-Listen to this. (reading the will) "To Heinz Doofenshmirtz, You are my only nephew, except for Roger and I hated him." See? See why I liked her? "Therefore, I leave you my castle and hidden inside is a very large treasure!" Huh? (puts on reading glasses) And look! There's a little treasure map with clues! Wanna help me? (no response) Oh, come on! It'll be fun! Take off your secret agent hat just for tonight and put on your adventure hat! (Perry takes off his fedora and puts on a similar looking fedora.) That's my guy! Treasure ho! This is gonna be fun! 
(Cut to the party.)
(Song: "Vampire Queens Love Pimpernels" (instrumental))
Vanessa: (offscreen) Welcome to my castle party! Here's a mask. Lacie, wow, great costume!
Lacie: This is a...costume party?
Knight: Sir Grant of the Goth Table has arrived.
Vanessa: You look great, Sir Grant. (gives him a mask) Goth dragons beware!
Candace: (also dressed as a vampire queen) Vanessa?
Vanessa: Candace!
Candace: Whoops! I guess your party's gonna have two vampire queens! What are the chances, right?
(Stacy enters also wearing an identical costume.)
Stacy: (leaves) I'm gonna go change.
Candace: How did you ever pull this off?
Vanessa: Well, my dad gave me permission to use his castle and then all I had to do was call the best party planners in town.
(Phineas and Ferb walk through the doors.)
Phineas: Ferb, you go get the 4:40 junction box hooked up behind the riser, and I'll check up on the pumpkin crudities.
Candace: Et tu, Vanessa?
Vanessa: I had to. This is a big night for me, my boyfriend's coming. Oh, here he is right now.
(A Scarlet Pimpernel enters.)
Scarlet Pimpernel: Ooh, a vampire! It's a good thing I have my neck covered.
Vanessa: You're not my boyfriend!
Scarlet Pimpernel: Whoops. Heh heh. Sorry, I thought you were my—
Candace: Jeremy, it's me, Candace!
Jeremy: Ooh, a vampire! It's a good thing I have my—
Candace: Yeah, heard you the first time. 
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz and Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: Alright, the first clue is in the letter. Let's see here:
"My treasure awaits you, keep on the trail.
A ride up the stairs from under a veil."
What kind of twisted gibberish is this? (Perry approaches a chair under a veil and uncovers it.) That's it! Henrietta's chairlift! Oh yeah! Here, (patting his knee) you can sit here, Perry the Platypus. (Perry shakes his head.) No? Alright, suit yourself. (He activates the chairlift.) We're comin' for your treasure, HenriettAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! (The chairlift speeds up and flings Doofenshmirtz into the red stained glass window. It seems like he's about to crash and break it, but doesn't. Instead, the window flips over and Doofenshmirtz lands in the moat and takes out a piece of paper.) Ha! I got it! (An alligator arises from the moat.) Yaaaah!! They shipped the alligator, too? Get away from me, Susan! We talked about this! 
(Cut back to the party.)
Phineas: These scalloped cheese slices should be staged directly across from the crackers. But overall, nice work. (He approaches Isabella dressed as Cinderella.) Hey, look at you! You're Isabellarella.
Isabella: If I lose a slipper tonight, you know where to find me.
Phineas: (walking away, pointing at something) Ooh, that reminds me...
Isabella: ("accidentally" losing a slipper) Whoops!
Phineas: (offscreen) ...there's some water on the floor over by the sally port.
(The "lost" slipper lands in the punch. Isabella angrily takes the shoe out. Cut to Buford and Baljeet dressed as the front and back end, respectively, of a dragon.)
Baljeet: Buford, it is so hot in here! Can I please have some punch?
Isabella: (saunters past) You don't wanna drink that.
Buford: Y'know, I think we have the best castle party costume.
Irving: (offscreen) Hey, Buford, look at me - (he is dressed as a castle) I'm a castle...at a castle party! Get it? Heh? Heh?
Buford: Yeah. Hey, Windsor, your drawbridge is down!
Irving: Oh, my. (raising his drawbridge) How embarrassing. 
(Cut to Vanessa)
Vanessa: Monty should've been here by now. (Another Scarlet Pimpernel approaches her.) Finally...wait, who are you?
Scarlet Pimpernel 1: I'm the Scarlet Pimpernel.
Scarlet Pimpernel 2: As am I!
Scarlet Pimpernel 3: Same here.
All Scarlet Pimpernels: We are all here!
Vanessa: Ugh!
Stacy: (enters, now also dressed as the Scarlet Pimpernel) Hey, what's going — Oh, for crying out loud. 
(Cut to Phineas.)
Phineas: Okay, Ferb, let's kick this biggest, baddest, Halloweeniest bash into high gear!
(All cheer. Ferb rises onto a DJ's stage and spins a megamix of some of the greatest hits on the show.)

Doofenshmirtz: "In the dungeon, you will find
An elevator out of time."
I really don't remember an elevator down here. (An elevator bell dings.) Well, whadaya know? How could I have missed it? (A couple of Shining twins walk out of the elevator.)
"In the elevator, to the top you go,
The next clue is down below."
(The elevator goes up.) Well, that doesn't really make a lot of sense. (The elevator reaches the top floor, which is just a view.) Why did she make us come all the way up here if the clue is all the way down— (The elevator drops like the Tower of Terror ride and drops back into the moat. A hippopotamus rises from the moat.) Wait a second! (Approaching the hippo, which has another clue in its mouth.) Gimme that thing! 
(Cut back to the party. Vanessa finally recognizes Monty.)
Vanessa: Now, that is my boyfriend.
(Monty winks at her. They walk up to each other to dance. Cut to Ferb, who takes off his DJ hat to reveal his hair is now gelled. He takes off his black turtleneck to reveal his dapper singer outfit from "De Plane! De Plane!" and puts on a fake mustache and replaces his microphone with a 1940s style version and sings.)

Phineas: What's wrong, Isabella?
Isabella: I ran out of shoes. (lifts up her gown to reveal she is now barefoot)
Phineas: Oh, that's okay. (throws off his shoes) It's more fun to dance barefoot anyway. (Phineas and Isabella begin dancing with each other.) 
(Cuts back to Monty and Vanessa. Monty accidentally bumps into his father, who is now dressed like a knight in shining armor.)
Monty: Oops, sorry.
Major Monogram: It's alright. (His visor drops on his eyes and he pushes it back up.) Monty, is that you?! With the daughter of my sworn enemy?! It can't be!! (Walks up to the Pimpernel next to Vanessa.) Alright, Monty, you've got a lot of explaining to— (the Pimpernel that is talking to Vanessa reveals herself to be Stacy.)
Stacy: Oh, hello, Mr. Water and Power Guy.
Major Monogram: I, uh, better check the...uh...thing. Yes. (leaves)
Vanessa: Thanks, Stacy! I owe you!
Stacy: No thanks are necessary for that darned elusive Pimpernel.
Vanessa: Hey, where did Monty go?
Stacy: Oh, he's up there on that window ledge.
(Cut to Monty.)
Monty: (tipping his hat) Until next time, my queen! (He exits dramatically.)
Vanessa: Wow! That was really kind of swashbuckle-y! 
(Cuts to outside the castle where it's revealed that Monty landed in the moat.)
Monty: Let's hope she didn't see that. 
(Cut back to the party.)
Doofenshmirtz: (offscreen) "By luck or by chance, you found your last clue.
Turn the corner, favorite nephew."
Well, uh, what does she mean, "turn the corner"? It's just a flat wall, it's a— What are you doing, Perry the Platypus? (Perry shows a combination lock near the corner of a picture frame.) Oh, the corner of her picture! Give it a turn with your little platypus hands there! (Perry turns the lock and an unlocking noise is heard and bags of cash drop out.) At last!! Wahoo!! I'm rich! I am rich! I am comfortably well off! Don't worry, Perry the Platypus, I won't forget about you. You'll be the next person I invite to my first piñata party!
Man 1: Uh, excuse me, sir, are you the owner of this here building?
Doofenshmirtz: Yes.
Man 1: This area's not zoned for medieval castles. You're gonna have to pay a penalty fee.
Doofenshmirtz: Penalty fee? How much?
Man 1: One canvas bag with a huge dollar sign on it. (Doofenshmirtz gives the man a bag.) Thank you. Here's your receipt.
Doofenshmirtz: At least I still have all this loot.
Man 2: Danville Water Management Department. Can I see your permit for that moat? (Doofenshmirtz gives him a bag.)
Man 3: Bureau of Castle Conservation.
Doofenshmirtz: All right. (gives him a bag)

Trick or Treaters: Trick or treat!
Linda: Oh, my! Look at all the fun costumes! (passing out candy) Here you go. And here's one for you. And here's one for the little princess. And one for you. Oh, but wait! Don't go away! (singsongy) We have a little surprise for you! (leaves)

Lawrence: Oh, I do so love Halloween!
Linda: We're gonna save a ton of money on candy this year! 
(Open on an overhead shot of the Flynn-Fletcher house. We see, Phineas and the gang in their skateboarding gear.)
Phineas: Okay, guys, now you try it. (Isabella jumps over a hydrant on her skateboard.) Nice! (Baljeet does it next.) Very smooth, Baljeet! (A skateboard with no rider bumps into the hydrant.) What's the problem, Buford?
Buford: Well, you know, the sun was in my eyes.
Isabella: Buford, what's with the lack of effort?
Buford: I'm just tryin' to be careful.
Phineas: You?
Buford: Yeah, we're outta credit at the emergency room. My mom said if I break one more bone, she's gonna break the rest of them! Fairly sure that was hyperbole, besides, look how hard that hydrant is!
Baljeet: Well, maybe we could make our own fire hydrants out of soft foam rubber.
Phineas: Hey, that's a great idea! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!
Ferb: Seriously? That's it? A soft fire plug?
Phineas: Well, yeah, attached to a giant revolving treadmill with a giant soft neighborhood containing soft obstacles.
Ferb: Oh, yeah, okay.
Baljeet: Where is Perry?
Isabella: What did you say?
Baljeet: I was just asking where Perry is.
Isabella: Oh.
(beat)
Baljeet: What did you think I said?
Isabella: Uh, well, I thought you said...uh...nevermind. It was too weird. 
(Cut to Perry in the bathroom. He climbs into the tub with his fedora and floaties on. He rotates the showerhead and a wall raises up. He turns the showerhead on and it speeds into the opening. Cut to outside. The bathtub comes out of the roof. The tub speeds along the road before coming to a traffic signal. A hot tub carrying Peter the Panda and two ladies speeds by. The light turns green. He speeds into the OWCA Plumbing Supply building. Cut to inside. It looks like a garage with the lair monitor inside.)

Major Monogram: Ooh, ooh, oh, get it off! G-Get it off! Ooh! Uh, just walked through a spiderweb. Don't you just hate that? Ya spend the rest of the day worried there's a spider on ya. (shudders) Gives me the willies. Anyhoo, our sources tell us there's a cowboy hat in front of Doof's building. Normally, that wouldn't be of any interest to us, since this is the week of the Danville Hootenanny, but it is a rather large hat and, in spite of its name, the Danville Hootenanny is a dignified affair. I wish I had more information, but Carl said there was a big bee by the surveillance equipment. So get out there, Agent P! Ooh! Carl, is there... (turns around revealing a huge tarantula on his back) is there a spider on my head?
Carl: (offscreen) No, sir. There's no spider...on your head. 
Narrator: Meanwhile, at the Danville Space Laboratory...
(The sign reads "Danville Space Labrador".)
Sign Painter: Laboratory?! (makes angry noises, throws his hat to the ground and stomps on it) 
(Cut to inside the Danville Space Laboratory where Linda, Jack Johnson, Candace, and Jeremy are taking a tour.)
Linda: Oh, Jack, it sure was nice of you to show Candace and me around. This satellite stuff is very interesting.
Jack: No problem, Linda. I'm flattered you'd be interested in our humble facility, considering your background in astrophysics.
Linda: Oh, yeah, uh, listen, that's kind of a secret, so don't—
Jack: Oh, I'm sorry.
Candace: So what does your father do here?
Jeremy: Oh, he's part of a team that makes and manages recognizant satellites. They actually had a couple of rovers on Mars earlier this summer. But they suddenly stopped working. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Candace: (nervously) Uh, how would I...heh heh...what do you mean? Heh heh.
Jeremy: All right...Your Highness.
Candace: (gasp) Who told?
Jeremy: Stacy.

♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! ♪
(Perry approaches Doof, who is sitting outside.)
Doofenshmirtz: Uh, Perry the Platypus, I bet you're wondering why I'm cowering outside my lab. Well, day started like any other day. You know, "how am I going to take over the Tri-State Area?" But I suddenly remembered a movie that I saw long ago at a drive-in.
(Flashback) 
(Doofenshmirtz watching a movie with gigantic kittens climbing on buildings.)
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) It was called Night of the Felis. I knew right away that the old masters were onto something. Imagine taking something cute and enlargening it to frightening proportions. Brilliant! But in order to take over the Tri-State Area, I had to study with some other types of small animals, preferably, something that could fly. And I vowed to get right to work...as soon as the movie was over. The first thing I needed to do was create an inator that would make things larger.
Doofenshmirtz: (in flashback) Eh?
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) I tried it out on my cowboy hat. It was a success! My ten-gallon hat had turned into a 2,000-gallon-hat!
(The hat falls off the balcony, Doofenshmirtz jumps off the hat and clutches to the balcony.)
Doofenshmirtz: (in flashback) Whoa! (crash!) Well, that's the end of that hat.
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) Next, I had to genetically modify a mouse so it could fly.
(In flashback, Doof takes a mouse. The mouse bites Doof offscreen.)
Doofenshmirtz: (in flashback) Ow!
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) Then I decided it would be easier to just use a bat. So I ordered a retired stunt-bat from a low-budget bat circus that had recently gone belly-up. You know...the economy. I was on the precipice of Tri-State Area domination. At last, I had the ultimate creepy soldier! (Derek the bat squeaks) And then I remembered, I had a very mild phobia of bats.
(Doofenshmirtz's eyes pop, literally, and he runs away from the bat.)
Doofenshmirtz: (in flashback) Aaaah!!! Get away get away get away!!!
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) I also had a mild phobia of shellfish.
(At the 'Shellfish Needs' restaurant.)
Waitress: (in flashback, offscreen) Here's your order, sir.
Doofenshmirtz: (in flashback, offscreen) Aaaah!!! Get away get away get away!!!
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) But bats are worse.
Doofenshmirtz: (in flashback) Scram, you flying gerbil! (Derek squeaks) Amscray! (Derek squeaks) You're making me miss the hootenanny!
Norm: (in flashback) Sir, I found your radio. It was embedded in the dashboard of your car.
Doofenshmirtz: (in flashback) Norm, don't just stand there! Do something about this bat! (The radio is thrown, and misses.) Really? That's your solution? Throw a radio at it? Whoa whoa! (cut to Norm about to throw a crowbar) Don't throw that! That's imitatable.
Norm: (in flashback, picking up the inator) What if I hit it with this?
Doofenshmirtz: (in flashback) No no! Don't shoot it with that! That's my—
(Derek gets hit with the inator.)
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) And I thought the bat was scary before when he was...tiny.
(End flashback.)
Doofenshmirtz: It was at that point that Norm and I decided to come out here. Plus the bat kinda looks like my cousin, Narthelliot, which, as you can imagine is weird for me. Isn't that about right, Norm?
Norm: (crashed through a hole in the wall) It's even more horrible than it looks! 
(Cut to the backyard, where a giant foam wheel is.)
Phineas: Everybody got their helmets and boards?
Isabella: Yeah!
Buford: I'm ready!
Baljeet: I am ready!

Doofenshmirtz: Thank you for the blanket, Perry the Platypus.
Vanessa: (offscreen) Dad?
Doofenshmirtz: Vanessa? Oh, no! Vanessa, get out of there! (Crawling inside) There's a huge bat on the loose!
Vanessa: Really? (Sees Derek shrieking.) Wow, cool! It looks like your cousin, Narthelliot.
Doofenshmirtz: No sudden movements or loud noises, Vanessa!
Vanessa: Dad, relax. It's just a bat. They just eat bugs.
Doofenshmirtz: But it's a very big bat!
Vanessa: Now, come on. J-Just stand up. It's time to face your fear.
Doofenshmirtz: Well, okay. (Derek snarls at Doofenshmirtz and grabs him in his mouth.)
Vanessa: (hitting Derek) No no! Bad bat! Spit him out!!
(Derek spits Doof out, who is now covered in bat saliva.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, gross! (Derek grabs Doofenshmirtz with his feet and flies away.) Oh, yeah, this is much better!
Vanessa: Dad!! Oh, hey, Perry. I was wondering if you could help me. (Perry grabs his jetpack and activates it.) Thanks, Perry. You're a peach.
(A bat-looking man appears next to Vanessa.)
Narthelliot: So, what'd I miss?
Vanessa: Oh, hey, Narthelliot! We were just talking about you. 
(Cut back to Danville Space Laboratory.)
Jack: Of course, even better than using a rover, we have these. We call them global surveillance satellites. No matter where you are on Earth, there's always one of these flying above you in orbit, streaming live video to us here.
Woman at Monitor: That's right. Here's the outside of our building right now. And we can look up any location instantly. The Eiffel Tower, the Taj Mahal...
Linda: So you could look down on anybody's backyard and see what they're doing?
Jeremy: Pretty cool, huh?
Candace: Wow, that's gotta be handy for something.
Jeremy: And three...two...one... (points to Candace in anticipation of her busting idea)
Candace: What?
Jeremy: Really? Alright. 
(Cut to the Giant Tire Place. Derek flies through the big tire around and around with Doofenshmirtz still in his clutches.)
Doofenshmirtz: Whoa! Oh, I get it! This is what it does! Flying through a hoop! That's what I get...for buying a bat...from a defunct...bat circus! 
(Cut to the Danville Space Laboratory cafeteria.)
Jeremy: So, having fun yet?
Candace: Oh, you know I am. (Sips her drink)
Jeremy: You know, my dad goes on and on about the cafeteria here, and I think he's right. This food is...
Candace: (does a spit take and gasps) I've got an idea! My brothers are probably building something in our backyard right now, and we can use the surveillance satellite to catch them doing it! (runs off) Come on!
Jeremy: I was wondering how long that would take. 
(Cut to the big monitor from earlier. Candace sits in the now empty chair with a sign saying "Out to Lunch.")
Candace: Just lemme punch in my address... (The backyard and Foamtown appears onscreen.) Omigosh, I knew it! Look at that thing!!
Jeremy: Wow! What is it?
Candace: it's an eye-in-the-sky bust! Come on, let's go get my mom! (they walk off)

Phineas: Okay, Ferb, turn it off. Let's take a little break. (Ferb pulls the lever and the wheel stops rolling. Buford falls off of the wheel landing on his back.) You okay, Buford?
Buford: I'm havin' the time of my life! Is anybody else hungry?!

(Doofenshmirtz's head crashes into the giant bolt revealing the cogs, which loosen and cause Foamtown to roll away.)

Candace: This way, Mom! (motions toward the screen) See for yourself!
Linda: Oh, wow! It's our house! (the screen shows the empty backyard and the kids) And you can see the boys! And their little skateboards! (waves) Hi, boys!

Doofenshmirtz: Perry the Platypus, welcome to St. Louis! Now do something about this bat, please! (Perry shoots the inator at Derek and it shrinks back to its original size, leaving Doofensmirtz hanging in midair, then falling.) Aah!! Well, at least I lost my fear of bats!! (Doofenshmirtz crashlands into a shellfish restaurant.)
Waitress: (offscreen) Oh, it's you again.

The egg goes down a slide and cracks into a frying pan. Cut to Phineas holding a tennis racket. He swipes a popped piece of toast with it. Ferb catches it and then some. Cut to Phineas by a percolator. He pours some coffee. Cut to Ferb putting some blueberries onto the plate. Phineas and Ferb wheel the breakfast out. Ferb returns to make the percolator disappear.)

Candace: (in Cockney accent) 'Ello, Grandpa Reg. (normal voice) Happy Father's Day.
Reginald: (on the computer) Thank you, love.
Linda: Hello, Reg. Are you having a "Grand"-Father's Day? (laughs) Hoo hoo!
Reginald: Ha ha ha! Good one!
Linda: I'll leave you boys to your Father's Day fun. Candace, are you ready to go?
Candace: Sure, mom. Bye, grandpa.
Reginald: 'Ey, where's Perry? 
(cut to Perry as he enters by using a playground set and hovers in the air)
Major Monogram: Morning, Agent P. I see you're trying out the new SFU 2000. It's a lot of fun, but don't let your duties slide.
Carl: Agent P, what do you think of his Father's Day gift?
Major Monogram: Yes, it's a lovely tie, but I'm not your father! (to Perry) Anyhoo, Doofenshmirtz has plans to gum up the entire Tri-State Area. And we need you to check it out. Good luck, Agent P.

(Perry gets trapped with gum)
Doofenshmirtz: Gotcha, Perry the Platypus! If you think this is a sticky situation, you better hold on to that fedora. Behold, the Gum-Under-The-Shoe-inator! I took all the wadded up chewing gum in the entire Tri-State Area and fed it into this -inator. Yeah, I know, it's really unsanitary. Why don't people just throw the chewing gum in the trash? Huh?
(Doofenshmirtz and Perry get shot by the -inator)
Doofenshmirtz: (sighs) Today just isn't my day. It's Father's Day. It's the hardest of the greeting card company holidays for me. My issues with Father's Day began back when I was a child.
(Flashback from Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror.)
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) Those were lean times for my father and our beloved lawn gnome was repossessed.
(End flashback.)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, I know you've heard that one before, but...twice actually...but I really think that this is where my relationship with my father went awry.
(Resume flashback.)
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) I mean, he made me be that lawn gnome!
Mr. Doofenshmirtz: Bewegen sie nicht! ("Don't move!")
(End flashback.)
Doofenshmirtz: I mean, he was really specific, too. He made me memorize the serial number of that particular lawn gnome. (While he talks, Perry goes onto the computer and opens the Lawn Gnome Tracker app.) DAEHM23. If only there was some way to reunite him with, y'know, that specific lawn gnome, maybe he and I could start again. (Looks at the computer.) DAEHM23?! You found him with an online gnome tracker? Wow, there really is an app for everything now, isn't there? Well, let's see. It says it's still in Drusselstein! Now I can heal the old wounds between my father and me! (gets up and walks but is stuck to the chair) Oh, man that is one of my most brilliant ideas yet! (His pointy nose pops the huge bubble made from the gum.) 
(Cut to the backyard where Phineas and Ferb are working on a biplane.)
Phineas: An exact replica of Grandpa's old biplane! Dad's gonna love this! (He and Ferb climb in and put on their helmets and goggles.) Let's try 'er out! (The plane takes off.) Now punch it! (Ferb pushes a button on a remote control and four jet engines come out from the wings and the plane increases speed.) Yeah! 
(Cut back to D.E.I. as the roof opens.)
Doofenshmirtz: (offscreen) I know traveling by cannon is a little unconventional...
(Cut to reveal Doof wearing a pilot's uniform and carrying Perry in a baby carrier and climbing into a giant cannon.)
Doofenshmirtz (cont'd): ...but the cannon place was going out of business, so I got them at a volume discount. (lights the fuse) Hang on. (The cannon fires.) Woohoo!
(Vanessa arrives at the door with a basket.)
Vanessa: Happy Father's Day, Dad! Dad?
(Cut to an airborne Doof and Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: Sorry for the lack of inflight meals or entertainment, Perry the Platypus, but one cannon can only go so far, so I set up a worldwide network.
(They land in another cannon somewhere in a field and take off again. Cut to a canon on an island. Doof and Perry miss their target and land in the water.)
Doofenshmirtz: Aw man! Missed it by that much! 
(Cut to the backyard where the plane lands.)
Phineas: Perfect landing, Ferb! I'll go get Dad. (Cut to the sliding door. Phineas leads his father out.) No peeking, Dad! Keep 'em closed! Okay, open 'em!
Lawrence: (gasps)
Ferb: Tada!
Lawrence: (voice breaking in tears) Thank you so much, boys! I can't think of a better Father's Day gift!

(Cut to Drusselstein where Doofenshmirtz and Perry finally land...on a cat no less.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Drusselstein! This way, Perry the Platypus. (Doof and Perry get up and the cat meows. Cut to outside Ye Olde Pawn Shoppe.) Okay, so the gnome tracker located my father's long lost lawn gnome to this location. (He opens the door and gasps.) There it is! (He picks up a lawn gnome, but it talks.)
Gnome: Hey, put me down!
Doofenshmirtz: Ah! I thought you were my father's lawn gnome.
Gnome: No worries. I get that all the time. Probably due to my height combined with my eccentric fashion choices.
Doofenshmirtz: Uh, yeah. Huh. Well, I'm looking for DAEHM23.
Gnome: (picks up the real lawn gnome behind him) Oh, yeah, it's been here for years. Here you go.
Doofenshmirtz: It is you! My father will be so happy! Well, maybe not happy, but anything is an improvement over surly and dismissive. Let the father-son healing begin!

Doofenshmirtz's Dad: Oh, hello, Heinz.
Doofenshmirtz: (sadly) Hello, Father.
Doofenshmirtz's Dad: I see you've brought me assorted broken bits of pottery for Father's Day. Well, I suppose it's the thought that, um...counts. Your brother, Roger, remembered how much I loved that old lawn gnome, so he sent me this. (walks up to a giant lawn gnome) Look, it also makes espresso. (The gnome opens a compartment door and an espresso spout pours some into a mug, which Doofenshmirtz's dad takes out and sips.) Delicious. But, you know, rubble is...a nice gift, too.
Doofenshmirtz: (voice breaking in tears) Alright...um...Happy Father's Day. And...okay, bye-bye. (leaves)
Doofenshmirtz's Dad: All zis way just to give me broken shards of potter— (gasps and sees the serial number) DAEHM23?!
(Cut to outside where Doof sits on the curb with Perry sadly.)
Doofenshmirtz: (sighs) Well, that could've gone better. (Perry consoles him.) Why do I even bother, huh? At least there's one relationship in my life that's worked out pretty well. Thanks for coming along, Perry the Platypus. Let's go home. (They walk away from the curb.) You are my rock. (Cut to a cannon.) And by that, I mean you're there for me, you're not made out of rock. You're actually made out of...well, platypus, probably. (They climb into the cannon, which fires.) 
(Cut to the backyard where the Fletcher Family Flying Circus lands.)
Lawrence: Well, that was the best Father's Day flight yet! It brought back some some wonderful old memories and created a lot of new ones. Thank you, boys, for making this possible!
Phineas and Ferb: (hugging their father) Happy Father's Day!
Lawrence: Yes. Yes it is.
Reginald: Crikey! It's getting late! I best be on me way home. Mind if I borrow your new aeroplane?
Lawrence: Why don't you hang onto it 'til next year? I've got no room left in the garage anyway.

Linda: Hi, honey! Hi, boys! So how was your day?
Lawrence: Oh, the boys and I spent a wonderful day flying with Father!
Linda: Ah, the internet is a wonderful thing.

Candace: Happy Father's Day, Dad!

Stacy: Obviously—
Candace: It's Jeremy. (Squeals) But you'll never guess where.
Stacy: (Sighs) I have no idea.
Candace: Neither do I. He says it's a surprise.
Stacy: Oh, lucky you.
Candace: The problem is if I don't know where we're going, I don't know what to wear.
Stacy: Oh! I know, Hair bows. They're all the rage this days. Just don't wear any feather-earrings, they're so last Tuesday.
Candace: (Puts feather-earrings down) Ah! Yeah, so last Tuesday, Ah hah. I-I would never wear something so Tuesdayish of last. 
(Switches to backyard with the boys and gang)
Phineas: Well, seems the parts didn't arrive for our Zombie-robot pool table. Anybody have any other suggestions?
Buford: Hey, remember how we did that super Rollercoaster? How 'bout a super duper Rollercoaster?
(Everyone stares at him)
Baljeet: So, you are just adding a "duper" then?
Buford: It's an acceptable suffix.
Isabella: We did a Portal to Mars. Maybe...a Portal to Venus?
Baljeet: Hah! Only if they make SPF 12 million.
Buford: Okay-okay! How 'bout a super-super duper-duper-duper Rollercoaster? What, too much or not enough?
Phineas: Actually, instead of improving one of our old inventions, we should make something brand new! Something simple.
Isabella: How do you mean?
Phineas: Well, what is summer all about? 
(Song: "Summer (Where Do We Begin?)")
Buford, Isabella, Baljeet: ♪ Summer is running through the sprinklers in your T-shirt, shoes, and-- ♪ 
Phineas: Yeah, we all know the song. (beat) But I'm not exactly sure how....
(Everyone pauses)
Buford: Well, Hurry up and think of somethin', I'm gettin' tired hanging around here.
Phineas: That's it Buford. You can't get more summer than a tire swing. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.
Buford: Uh, hatch mosquitoes?
Phineas: No. Hey! Where's Perry? 
(Perry goes down the basement staircase, stopping at the landing next to the Panic Room, opens the bottom stair, stops himself halfway down the slide after forgetting his hat, retrieves it from the stairs, and goes back down into his lair.)
Major Monogram: Morning, Agent P, We have a report that Doofenshmirtz is at the Shark. We don't know which Shark, but it sounds bad. Ugh! Gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it...
Carl: Sir, it was a typo, Doof isn't at the Shark, he's at the park.
Major Monogram: Well then, that's a lot lower on my heebie-jeebie scale. So Agent P, uh, change of plan. Head over to the park and stop Doof from doing the doings that Doof does ...do (Clears throat)
(Perry salutes then leaves his lair)
Carl: You have a heebie-jeebie scale, sir?
Major Monogram: Yeah. You're on it. 
(Switches to the Flynn-Fletcher backyard)
Phineas: An old-fashioned tire-swing but huge and powered by jet-engines that can flatten a small village. Baljeet have you calibrated the ailerons yet?
Baljeet: Oh sure, calibrated the ailerons...
Buford: I'll just stay here and fiddle with stuff so I look busy.
(Buford removes a random part from a control console, and a ray shoots. Buford panics and quickly replaces the part)
Phineas: Hey, Buford.
Buford: What? I didn't take nothing out of nowhere. But, uhm, just as a hypothetical. Uh... What do you think would happen if say you took that goofy doohickey-thing out of the thingamawhatsit?
Phineas: Hmm... Good question. Ferb? (Opens a blueprint.) Well, if we account for the coolness of the jet propulsion circuits this early in the day and the increased internal humidity while that access port is open, removing the part in question would cause the machine to emit a ray that turns a human into a fly.
Buford: Really?
Phineas: You'd be surprised how often removing a single component can make the difference between one thing and a highly complicated totally unrelated other thing. For instance, if you remove this part it will become a Sorbet machine. Why do you ask?
Buford: Oh, no reason. 
Candace: A hair bow? Only Stacy can pull this off. (Screams) I'm a fly, how is this possible? Phineas and Ferb, you are so buzzzzzzzzted! Mom!
(Wide shot of downstairs. Candace flies around.)
Candace: Bzzzz! Bzzzzzzz!!! Bzz bzzz bzzzzzz! Bzzzzzz! (close up on fly Candace as she buzzes in her mother's ear) Mom, look! Phineas and Ferb invented somethin' that turns people into flies!
(Wide shot of Linda)
Candace: Bzzzz bzzzzzz!
Linda: Ew, get away, fly! Shoo! Oops! I'm late for my appointment.
Candace: Bzzzzz! Bzzzzz! Mom! It's me! Mom!!! You need to bust the boys and get them to turn me back into me before Jeremy gets back here! (wide shot as Candace realizes she's in the car with Linda, who starts the ignition) What?! (She flies in place but not before smashing into the window) Help meeeeee! 
(Scene shifts to Danville Park. Cut to Doofenshmirtz having a picnic. Agent P approaches him)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus, won't you join me for a picnic? (Perry hesitates but then walks up, but not before sinking into his trap. Doofenshmirtz laughs.) Ah! Ah! Ow, my duodenum. Oh, oh, did you see your face?! You were like, "Ooh, maybe I shouldn't," but you're then, "Well, I am hungry" and then BOOM! down you went! Ha-ha! And are you hungry, Perry the Platypus? (Picks up the picnic basket) Well, too bad, it's not for you. It's for them. (Whip pan to reveal pigeons eating seeds. Cut back to Doofenshmirtz, who retrieves an inator from the basket) Behold! My feed-the-pigeons-inator! (Perry just gives Doofenshmirtz a look) Okay, Snobby the Snobapus, I know it doesn't sound like much, but it is technically evil. I am breaking the law. See? (whip pan to a sign saying, "DO NOT FEED THE PIGEONS!") There? There. "Do not feed the pigeons". And I am going to feed the pigeons, therefore I am breaking the law. "Do not feed the pigeons". It's a-it's a metal sign with......big red letters on it and that makes it.......legally binding. (covers his eyes) Okay, here's the truth: I got evil scientist's block, alright? (sighs) Seriously, I got—I got nothing. I—I was going to make a good-idea-inator, but I thought it would be counterproductive because it already had "good" in the title. So then I invented a bad-idea-inator, which...just...gave me this. And see where that got me. Ah, I'm telling ya, I'm dry, Perry the Platypus. Dry! And the summer just keeps going on and on and it feels like it's been goin' on for, like, four years! I'm asking ya man to monotreme, can you help me? (Perry comes out of his hole and leads Doofenshmirtz) See? Even my trap design has become...lackluster. 
(Scene shifts to the backyard. Pan down to reveal a giant tire swing)
Phineas: Lady and gentlemen, may we present the good old-fashioned new-fashioned tire swing! (Cut to inside the tire swing to reveal Phineas, Isabella, Ferb, Baljeet and Buford inside the tire) Prepare to engage thrusters! (The tire begins swinging back and forth with rocket launchers) The fully-pressurized cabin is gyroscopically balanced for a perfectly smooth ride.
Baljeet: Hmmm. Now it just feels like we are watching a movie.
Phineas: (pushing a red button) True, but we can also go old school! Hang on, everybody!
(They drop out of the tire revealing themselves riding separate tire swings.)
Isabella: This is great!
Buford: I have never been so sick to my stomach!! 
(Cut back to Danville Park)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, I think I've gleaned from your expression that you are now going to lead me through a series of bizarre and seemingly unrelated exercises that will help me get my groove back. Does that about sum it up? Good. Let's do this thing!
(Perry and Doofenshmirtz do some aerobic steps. They then do some trust exercises. Doofenshmirtz is then shown painting a picture. He steps aside to reveal the picture is a badly drawn happy face. Perry shakes his head. Perry and Doofenshmirtz do some more aerobic steps. Doofenshmirtz paints again. He steps aside to reveal a painting in the style of René Magritte's The Son of Man painting, only with Perry in place of the man's body with an apple for a face. Perry shakes his head again. Doofenshmirtz puts his head in his hands. Perry offers him a handkerchief. Doofenshmirtz does some pushups while Perry sits on him while eating a sandwich. Doofenshmirtz is seen painting once more. He steps aside revealing a painting of an inator. Perry gives him a thumbs-up. Doofenshmirtz smiles as the camera zooms in on the painting. Fade in on the painting to reveal the inator built. Zoom out to show Doofenshmirtz holding Perry's hand and walking up to the inator.) 
(Scene shifts back to Linda's car.)
Candace: Bzzzz! Bzzzzzz! Bzzz bzz bzzzzz!
Linda: You again? Ha ha! Looks like I took you on a little trip. (opens her window) Get back to your family, little fella.
(Close up on Candace)
Candace: Little fella? What of me looks like a little FELLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! (she tumbles out the window)

(The song ends as Candace sees Jeremy on the phone)
Candace: (gasp) This is Jeremy's house! And there's Jeremy! At last! A silver lining! I can find out where we're goin' tonight! A girl's gotta know what a girl's gotta wear.
Jeremy: Yeah, it's a total surprise. I'm taking her to the rodeo.
Candace: The rodeo? I love rodeos! Wait, do I love rodeos or is that because I'm a fly?
Jeremy: Oh, hang on, Coltrane, there's a fly in here. Lemme get it.
(Candace screams and dodges a newspaper swatting her. She screams again as she realizes she's being followed by some Fireside Girls with a jar)
Gretchen: There's one!
Holly: C'mon, Fireside Girls!
Ginger: Let's get it!
(Candace buzzes away from the girls)
Holly: Well, girls, there goes our lizard-feeding patch.
Candace: Zzzzzz...zzzzzz! (she lands on a water spout. Close up as she catches her breath) Could this day get any weirder?
Male Voice: Hello.
(Zoom out to reveal the voice came from a fly with a human head on it.)
Candace: Omigosh, were you turned into a fly, too?
Human Fly: Who me? No. I was always a fly. I just got shot with a human-head-inator and...now I got this thing! It's really uncomfortable. How do you walk around with these?
Candace: Tell me about it. Be glad you don't have a freakishly long neck! (She buzzes out of frame) 
(Scene shifts to the backyard as the gang exits the tire swing and talk excitedly about it.)
Isabella: That was the most fun ever!
Phineas: Yeah! And let's restock the snack bar and go again!
Baljeet: Now there is something you do not see every day: a fly with orange hair.
(The orange-haired fly lands on Phineas's palm)
Phineas: Orange hair? (takes out a loupe) Uh oh! (POV shot from the loupe to show a really ticked-off Candace fly) Candace has been turned into a fly! (cut back to Phineas) Wait a minute! Did someone take the doohickey out of the thingamawhatsit? (looks aside) Buford?
Buford: Uhhh...oh no! If I catch the mug what did this...Yeah I'm on it! (he walks to the control panel) Okay, I just pull on... (he activates something and a yellow ray shoots out)
(The ray shoots Candace, transforming her into an alligator.)
Buford: (offscreen) Whoop! Wrong one!
(The ray shoots Candace, transforming her into a crying baby)
Buford: (offscreen) Not that one!
(The ray shoots Candace, transforming her into a squirrel, then the Giant Floating Baby Head, then a sasquatch, then a giant praying mantis, then her human form, then a piece of Red Leicester cheese, then an orange traffic cone)
Phineas: Wa-wait! Go back two!
(Candace is transformed back into the cheese and then back into her human form)
Candace: (gasps, happily) Oh thank you thank you thank you thank you! (exits then enters again, angrily) I mean, you are so busted! (exits again, then enters again, happily) But thank you!
Buford: Took a few tries there! If I weren't thinking, I woulda just pressed this "fly" button. (He presses the fly button, causing the giant tire swing to launch, taking the pedestal with it) Oh, that kind of fly! 
(Cut to the sky, where the giant tire swing launches into space, breaking away the pedestal. Cut to space where a shuttle passes the giant pedestal)
Astronaut: Woah, that is so weird! We're in a space shuttle and the shuttle program ended years ago! 
(Cut back to the backyard as the gang looks wide-eyed at the sky)
Isabella: I guess that's it. Fun's over.
Phineas: Au contraire. (He pushes a button and the control panel changes into a sorbet machine. He passes out a couple of sorbets to his friends) Sorbet? 
(Cut back to Danville Park. Doofenshmirtz and Perry are standing in front of the inator)
Doofenshmirtz: This is great! The best inator I've ever made! And you know what, Perry the Platypus? There's no self-destruct button on this, so there's no way you can stop me from taking over the entire Tri-State— (The giant tire swing lands on his inator before he finishes his statement) Huh. Well, like my Uncle Boris used to say, "When life's goin' well, a giant tire comes along and smashes your inator." We all thought he was crazy at the time, but now it seems rather prophetic. 
(Cut back to the backyard where the gang are enjoying their sorbets under the tree)
Buford: I don't get why this stuff is called "sorbet"? Ain't it just a fancy people word for "ice cream"?
Ferb: While ice cream is made from dairy products and turned vigorously with air, sorbet is made entirely out of fancy people.
Buford: Really?
Ferb: No, not really.
Jeremy: Hey, guys! (He comes in dressed in his fancy suit) Is Candace around?
Candace: (offscreen) Hey there, Jeremy! (cut to the sliding door to reveal Candace in a cowgirl outfit, speaking in a western accent) A lil' birdie told me we were goin' to the rodeo! 
(Scene shifts to a rather fancy restaurant)
Maitre d': (French accent) Actually, sir, it is pronounced "ro-day-o".
Jeremy: Oh, yeah. My mistake.
Maitre d': (to Candace) May I take your order..."partner"?
Candace: (sighs) I don't suppose it's Dress Like a Cowboy and Get Your Dinner Free Night.
Maitre d': No, madame. That is Tuesdays. 
(wide shot of Danville, covered in snow; cut to the Flynn-Fletcher backyard)
Phineas: Okay, Ferb. Open the floodgates. (Ferb turns the hose open and water comes out from the sprinklers): What do you think?
(The backyard has been transformed into an ice hockey rink)
Baljeet: It is like our own miniature Canada! But, of course, without the beavers, moose, and disproportionate number of comedians.
Phineas: Or Canadian bacon.
Buford: I forgot all about Canadian bacon.
Baljeet: You realize it is only ham.
Candace: (Off-screen) Phineas! (Walks on screen) And Ferb! You are soooooo busted!
(Lawrence crosses the screen spinning around the ice rink)
Lawrence: Hello, boys, splendid job on the hockey rink. (He crashes into a snowbank) Well, that was amusing.
Phineas: Great skating, Dad!
Lawrence: Boys, I've got some good news for you. I've arranged for you to play a little exhibition match between the periods of the Danville Ice Trays game.
Phineas: Oh, you mean like at halftime?
Lawrence: Well, it's three periods, so it's really two-thirds time.
Buford: Bland sports terms. That's what keeping the Canadians down.
Phineas: If we're going to be the entertainment, then we'd better kick it up a notch. Hockey Z-9?
Ferb: Hockey Z-9.
Buford: Oh, like Football X-7.
Baljeet: What happened to Y-8?
Phineas: Oh, we're saving that for croquet. Ferb, grab your toolbox. We've got work to do. (they exit)
Candace: (scoffs) What's the big deal with hockey anyway?
Lawrence: Well, it's hard to explain actually, taking the flip pass from the winner, shoulder deking the defense men, and then, tossing it right over the old glove hand. Oh, it just takes hold of you like a fever!
Candace: Did you play a lot of hockey in England there, Dad?
Lawrence: Never once.
Jeremy: (off-screen) Hey, Candace. (walks right on-screen behind Candace)
Candace: Oh, hi, Jeremy.
Jeremy: What a great ice rink.
Candace: Wouldn't it just be perfect for figure skating?
Jeremy: (as Candace says "figure skating") Ice hockey!
Candace: What? Oh yeah. Ice hockey.
Jeremy: I didn't know that you were a hockey fan, Candace.
Candace: (chuckles) You betcha! Flipping over win passes, and then shoulder dorkin' the old jazz hands. It's like some kind of disease!
Jeremy: Uh... yeah.
Lawrence: Say, Jeremy, why don't you join us at the exhibition game today?
Jeremy: Sounds like fun.
Candace: Oh yeah. Sounds like... (makes phone noise) BRRRRING!! Oh, hey. I got a phone call from, um... a real person. Gotta go. (walks out of backyard, calling Stacy on her phone) Stacy, we have a Code Teal.
Stacy: (looking at a color wheel) Locusts? Are you sure?
Candace: No, wait. I mean Code Periwinkle.
Stacy: Periwinkle. A hockey emergency? I'm on it!
Candace: Speaking of periwinkle, where is Perry? 
(Perry enters his lair through an elevator in a shack on a frozen pond)
Major Monogram: Carl, I'm freezing. Did you call that repair guy yet?
Carl: I left him a message, sir. I think he went to Aruba for winter break.
Major Monogram: Lucky dog. It's cold in... Oh! Agent P! Didn't hear you come in. I have no idea what Doofenshmirtz is up to. It seems all of our computers froze. Isn't that right, Carl?
Carl: (is seen with his hands inside an ice-encased computer) Tech support says everything is fine.
Major Monogram: Well, I'm sure whatever Doof is up to, he's probably much warmer than we are, and that alone should be reason to stop him! Good luck, Agent P! (Perry salutes and exits his lair) 
(at the Danville Mountain Top Winter Arena)
Dink Winkerson: Welcome, hockey hounds, to the hypothermic hippodrome of Danville Mountain Top Winter Arena where our own Danville Ice Trays will cross sticks with the combative cross-town contenders. Reigning over the skating skirmish tonight as guest referee is Hockey Hall of Famer, Luc Robitaille!
Luc Robitaille: Is anyone else cold? Why is it so cold in here?
Audience: We don't know, Luc Robitaille!
Man in audience: Actually, I brought a blanket. So, I'm okay.
(Song: "F-Games" (instrumental))
Lawrence: Here we are.
Linda: Oh, this is so exciting! I've always wanted to be a hockey mom.
Candace: Excuse me for a second. (walks out and presses bluetooth button) System check. Stacy, can you read me?
Stacy: (on headphones talking to Candace) I've got the hockey reference manuals, league website, and official rules up and ready!
Ginger: Stacy, Mom said it's my turn to use the computer!
Stacy: Not now, Ginger. I'm busy.
Ginger: Don't make me open a can of whipped cream on you! Or however that goes. 
♪ Doofenshmirtz evil igloo on a mountain top, eh? ♪
(Perry parachutes from an airplane down the igloo's chimney)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus! (on an ice chair holding a mug of hot chocolate) Come in! How do you like my evil igloo hideout up in the Danville Mountains? Would you like some hot cocoa? No? Then, how about a marshmallow! (Doofenshmirtz launches a giant marshmallow out of his cocoa mug, trapping Perry) Ha. Ha! Trapped you again! I think I figured out why I haven't been able to take over the Tri-State Area. I've been too much of a nice guy. Nice guys can't take over large metropolitan areas, except for Roger. But, we're not talking about Roger. I've got to get mean. (Doofenshmirtz slides his chair across the igloo's floor; his cocoa mug falls and breaks) I've got to get ugly and possibly hairy. (Doofenshmirtz's chair slides past a picture of the abominable snowman) I've got to learn to be more like the abominable snowman. (chair crashes; a cat screeches) So, I decided to build this! Behold, the Abominable-nat... The, the Abominama... The A-bom-in-a-ble-i-nat-or. See, I can only say it if I speak slowly. The Abominable... Inator. Oh look, if I, if I separate it, it works. The Abominable Inator! It makes whatever it hits bigger and scarier and hairier. Anyhoo, behold. (removes cover from the Abominable-inator, which is covered in a huge scarf and knitted cap; Perry looks unimpressed) Okay, I know what you're thinking: "Why the silly little stocking cap and scarf?" The truth is, I, uh... I had some yarn. 
(back at the hockey arena)
Dink: And the blare of the buzzer brings down the metaphorical curtain on the scintillating second period of this titanic tussle as the grim, gritty gladiators vacate the frozen field of flailing, fighting flugelhorn to prepare for the third period of this tellican, turf-toes tower as the frosty defibrillators mill the frozen peems of icy... (gasps) Oh, man. I better go lay down.
Candace: So when all the members of the offending team clear the defensive zone at the same time, the delayed offset call is negated.
Jeremy: Wow, you really do know hockey.
Candace: Are you kidding? Did you know a referee makes most penalty calls-
Stacy: (to Candace over the phone, reading from a rulebook) While the linesmen may call only obvious technical infractions. (to Ginger) Go away!
Candace: Obvious technical infractions. Go away. The player who committed the infraction is no give me that. No Ginger, I'm busy. I said give me that back. If you don't give that back to me right now, Candace, gotta go.
(Candace smiles nervously after realizing what she said)
Dink: Now for your entertainment, what we've all been waiting for: Little Kids On Ice!
Linda: This is so exciting! (her camera beeps) Oh, I forgot to charge the battery. Oh no, I can't miss this photo op! Where is the gift shop?!
Lawrence: Uh, it's way over there, on the other side of the arena.
Linda: I'll be right back. 
(back at Doofenshmirtz's igloo; the Abominable-inator is loaded onto a sled)
Doofenshmirtz: Behold, Perry the Platypus, as I make myself abominable. (Doof presses the button on the -inator's remote. The -inator's beam bounces off the igloo and hits the marshmallow trapping Perry, causing it to burst and splatter all over Doofenshmirtz.) Ooh, it's all marshmallow-y and hairy. Not completely unlike summer camp. Apparently, you gotta aim this thing a little better... (the -inator shoots a beam directly at Doof's rear end) Whoa! Owww! Hmmm, something's not right in the hinterland. (his bottom suddenly becomes large and hairy, causing him to fall on the front of the sled) Yikes! Oof! (the igloo slides off the mountain top and hits a rock, causing it to break; Perry flies into the air and grabs the scarf trailing from the -inator) 
(back at the arena)
Phineas: (skating onto the ice with Ferb) Okay, Ferb, looks like we're on.
(Ferb pulls a lever, plunging the arena into darkness; the scoreboard, instead of showing the score, now displays "HOCKEY Z 9")
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be transported to a world where everything you know is changed into a global, glacial dystopia. (large, flaming ice sculptures rise up from the rink) If you're looking for something fluffy, forget it, pal, because this is the future, where the only things left are hard, cold, and in most cases pointy. It's a world where the only way to survive is to play hockey while things blow up around you. It's a world of skillful skating (Baljeet skates into a spotlight) and incredible ice ramps, (Django launches off a ramp into the rink) puck-pushing prowess (Buford enters, crashing through some barrels) and savage stone gladiators. (Phineas and Ferb skate into the center of the rink)
Candace: Oh, this is so bustable! (to Linda's now-empty seat) Mom, D... Where's Mom?
Lawrence: She went to the gift shop to buy a disposable camera.
Candace: What the heck is that? 
(cut to the gift shop; David, not getting the concept, is behind the counter)
Linda: It's a camera, that you send away to get the film part developed, and then you take the non-film camera-only part, and you throw it away.
David: What the heck is film?
Linda: (completely exasperated) Would you please just look in the back? 
(back to the Hockey Z-9 arena)
Announcer: This is the harsh, hybrid hockey of your dark, dystopian destiny.

Isabella: (in her announcer voice) Hockey Z-9! (in her normal voice) Thanks, Dink. Gotta get on the ice!

(back on the mountain with the sliding Abominable-inator)
Doofenshmirtz: (as the sled goes off a ramp) Aaaaugh!! (Perry climbs up the scarf and lands on the front of the sled as Doof's feet grow big and hairy, causing his shoes to fly off) Oh, my feet! Now it's working. (several more pops are heard as Doof becomes completely abominable) Hey, not bad. A little hairy, but not bad. Now, to deal with you! (Doof grabs for Perry, who darts under his legs) Gotcha! Hey, where'd you go? (Perry tugs on Doof's back hair) Oh, there you are. (Perry beckons Doof to come closer) Yes? (Perry punches Doof, whose head causes the Abominable-inator to point upwards) Ow! Ow, Oh, stupid thing! (Doof attempts to adjust the -inator, but it hits him in the head again) Ow! (the -inator fires) 
(back at the arena)
Candace: (trying to enter the rink) 'Scuse me, I gotta get through here.
Luc Robitaille: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not allowed out there.
Candace: But I gotta go get my mom, and this is the shortcut to the gift shop!
Luc Robitaille: I'm sorry, you can't go out there. That's for players only.
Candace: Players, huh?
Luc Robitaille: You're gonna go get a uniform and try to get out there, aren't you?
Candace: Is that a problem?
Luc Robitaille: No, as long as we're clear on the concept. 
(in the gift shop; David has opened a box marked "80's")
David: Hey, look at that! There was one in our "disposable stuff from the 80's" box.
Linda: Thanks, David. (runs out)
David: Let me know if you need more things to throw away! 
(back on Doofenshmirtz's sled)
Doofenshmirtz: Where the heck... hey, how'd you get over there? Don't do that! (Perry pries a board off the sled) Oh man! (Perry jumps off the sled and uses the board as a snowboard, grinding a rail while traveling down the mountain) Okay, now you're just showing off! (Perry spots trees ahead and snowboards off to the right) What? Is there something I should... AAAHHHH!! (Doof crashes into the top of a tree, bending it down) I fail to see how this could get any worse. (Doof's head turns back to normal) Oof! (the rest of Doof's body turns back to normal; now lighter, the tree catapults Doof into the distance) Curse you, Perry the Platypus! (trails off) 
(the Abominable-inator fires one more time before tumbling off a cliff; the beam hits a Zamboni, which becomes abominable)
Zamboni driver: Okay, I'm pretty sure that's not supposed to happen. Mr. Stevens! (runs into the arena) Mr. Stevens, I'm having trouble with the equipment! (the abominable Zamboni enters the arena)
Linda: (walking through a crowd of cheering fans with foam fingers) Sorry. Excuse me. Yes, you are Number One. Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me. Alright, alright, al... excuse me!
Phineas: (noticing the abominable Zamboni) Aw, check it out, a monster ice-polishing machine! Okay everyone, looks like we're done, let's get out of here. (the abominable Zamboni clears the rink back to normal and exits the arena, revealing the kids and Luc Robitaille in a perfect picture pose)
Linda: Oh my gosh. That is the cutest thing I've ever seen. Everyone say "Canadian bacon!"
Phineas, Ferb, Buford, Baljeet, Isabella, Django, Luc Robitaille: Ham! (Linda takes the picture)
Luc Robitaille: Great job, kids. (Candace skates onto the ice behind them, dressed in full hockey gear) That was the weirdest game of hockey I've ever seen.
Phineas: Thanks, Mr. Robitaille! (the kids skate off the rink)
Candace: Okay, I'm all set to sneak across the ice.
Luc Robitaille: Go ahead. Hockey Z-9 is over. (skates away)
Candace: What? No! Mom, they had giant dangerous... with a... (snaps hockey stick over thigh) It's not fair! (throws down gloves, gets into fighting stance) It's so not fair!
Luc Robitaille: (skating back; blows his whistle) Unsportsmanlike behavior! (points to the penalty box)
Candace: (skates there) Fine. 
(Candace is sitting in the penalty box)
Jeremy: Wow, Candace, I had a really good time. You want to get something to eat?
Candace: Oh, that sounds like fun! But give me two minutes. (notices Perry sitting next to her) Oh, there you are Perry.
(Perry chatters) 
(Scene opens up with a view of the sun in the sky. Pan down to the backyard with Isabella, Phineas, Perry, Ferb and Buford sitting by the tree.)
Phineas: I think this might be the hottest day on record.
Buford: Wait. (He puts his finger in his mouth, takes it out and the saliva on his finger sizzles.) Yep.
Baljeet: (offscreen) Hi, guys.
Phineas: Hey, Baljeet! How was physics camp?
Baljeet: Positively remedial. How much more basic can you get than the surface tension of water droplets?
Buford: Surfer tension? What's that?
Baljeet: Surface tension is the property which allows molecules of water on its surface to form a sort of stretchy skin, which allows it to retain its shape and durability at a small size.
Phineas: Cool! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!
Buford: (watch beeps) Not me.
Baljeet: Really? And what are you doing today?
Buford: With the hurly-burly of my busy social calendar, I often forget to have quality time with my pet goldfish, Biff. (bows) So I shall smell...you later. (he exits)
Baljeet: Wow, "Smell you later" sounds a lot more formal when you bow.
Phineas: Well, Ferb, I know what the rest of us are gonna do today.
Isabella: Speaking of pets, where's Perry? 
(Cut to Agent P by the garden shed. He rolls up a section of the lawn revealing a hole, which he dives into. His wristwatch communicator beeps while inside the tunnel.)
Major Monogram: (on watch, whispering) Sorry I can't be there, Agent P, (cut to the watch showing Monogram's eyes) but I'm stuck on jury duty. You'll be getting your mission today from Director Dipthong from accounting. Good luck. (gavel bangs, Monogram pulls away and speaks to the offscreen judge) Uh, uh, no, Your Honor, I'm not speaking on a mobile device. I...I'm talking to...a wart on my hand. (to the watch) Go away, wart! Go away!
(Cut to Agent P's lair as Perry finally lands onto his chair. The screen activates revealing a plain man wearing a military uniform similar to Monogram's only with the initials DD instead of MM on it.)
Director Dipthong: Hello, Agent P. It's me, Director Dipthong...from accounting. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying an exorbitant amount of negative ion generators and negative power cable and I'm positive that it can't be good. (Perry rolls his eyes) Yeah. Eh, so go find out what Doofenshmirtz is up to and put a stop to it. Descending Dipthong! (He sinks down from the screen)
Carl: What are you doing?
Director Dipthong: (going back up) It's my signature sign-off. What do you think? "Descending Dipthong." (sinks down from the screen again)
Carl: I'd stick with accounting. 
(Cut back to the Flynn-Fletcher house. Zoom in on Candace's room where she is on the phone.)
Candace: Can you believe how hot it is today, Jeremy? Even my dollies are sweatin'! Not that I play with dolls. I just happen to have a couple on my shelf next to my unicorn. Heh. (slaps her forehead in realization of what she just said)
Jeremy: Cool. So what do you wanna do today?
Candace: I don't know. I thought maybe we could head to the mall.
Jeremy: I suppose we could go to the mall again.
(Zoom in on Candace's brain as the words "the mall again" echo.)
Candace's Brain #1: Really? The mall again? Wow, you are so predictable! So ordinary!
Candace's Brain #2: Predictable? Ordinary? I mean, come on! I play 20 instruments!
Candace's Brain #1: Yeah, that all start with the letter "B", as in boring.
Candace's Brain #3: (skipping daffily) ♪ Tra la la la la la la la la la la la la la la... ♪
Candace's Brain #2: Who's that?
Candace's Brain #1: Just pretend she's not there. That's what I do.
Jeremy: (offscreen) Candace?
(Zoom back out on Candace)
Jeremy: Candace?! Are you there?
Candace: Uh, yeah. Yes, sorry. Forget the mall. I'm gonna think of something else to do that's really cool and totally different. 'Cause, y'know, I gotta be my unpredictable self, so Candace is out, peace! Uh, y'know what? That's so overused. Candace is out. (daffily) ♪ Tra la la la la la la la la ♪ (hangs up)
Linda: Candace, I'm on my way to...You know, this feels awfully familiar: I tell you I'm going out, later you'll tell me Phineas and Ferb are up to something, but there's nothing there to see, so we all have pie. Just another ordinary day.
Candace: Ordinary?! Do I ordinarily do this? (She pushes her dollies off the shelf and laughs while ripping the sheets off her bed and goes cuckoo again) ♪ Tra la la la la la la la la la la la la la la, Tra la la la la la LA!!!!! ♪
Linda: Like I said, just another ordinary day. 
(Cut to D.E.I.)
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated ♪ 
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz's lab where he is in a tank top, shorts, and socks, putting together his latest inator.)
Doofenshmirtz: Aw, man, why did I save all the manual labor on my newest inator for the hottest day of the year? I might as well be doing hot yoga up in this piece! Can I get a "what-what?" (no response) Norm, where's my "what-what?"
Norm: I'm sorry, sir. People do not say that anymore.
Doofenshmirtz: How do you stay so current?
(Perry appears on the balcony in his jet pack)
Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus, won't you have a seat? (A chair lying on its back emerges from the floor and traps Perry) That is not not how you sit on a chair! Which means it is! Because I used a double negative! Sure, it's grammatically incorrect, but it's the core of my newest creation: the Double Negative-inator! It takes any negative statement and turns it into a double negative, which...which, in turn, makes it positive, I... Anyway, I...I was dreaming about cold weather because it's been so hot lately and I remembered how much I loved the Minty Wink Eggnog they make at Beverly's Lunch downtown... 
(Flashback to Doofenshmirtz at Beverly's Lunch)
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) ...so I went out to get one. But then, Beverly told me I couldn't have it because they only make it in the winter. No matter how I begged and pleaded, she stood firm. No Minty Wink Eggnog! Because it's not winter!
(End flashback) 
Doofenshmirtz: Ugh! Anyway, once I recovered from the shock, I did what I always do: solve a simple problem by inventing a complicated and menacing machine. All I have to do is blast Beverly with this and bzzt! she'll be like, "Oh, I guess you can have it, 'cause it's not not winter" and, suddenly, I'm drinkin' Minty Wink Eggnog, baby! Perhaps then, I can make myself not not ruler of the Tri-State Area! Huh? Huh? You didn't see that coming, did you? (Perry chatters) Oh, don't be cranky, Perry the Platypus, you can have a Minty Wink Eggnog, too. 
(Cut to the backyard where Baljeet, Isabella, Phineas and Ferb are in their swimwear.)
Phineas: Nice work, guys! (Cut to a wide shot of the backyard to reveal a giant ball of water next to them) We'll have no trouble beating the heat with the world's largest drop of water.
Baljeet: Yes! By my calculations, we have effectively strengthened the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, so that the surface tension is virtually unbreakable! In your face, physics camp! Booyah!
Phineas: Come on, gang! Let's surf the surface tension! (Cut to reveal Phineas and Isabella surfing on the giant waterball) Cowabunga!
Isabella: Totally awesome!
(Cut to Ferb who is jet skiing on the water ball. Wide shot to reveal Baljeet and the Fireside Girls also having fun in the giant water ball) 
(Cut to Buford's house.)
Buford: (offscreen) Okay. Today's the big day of the Danville Fish Show. (Cut to Buford's bedroom to reveal he's talking to Biff) Are ya nervous? (Close up on Biff who bubbles.) Don't worry about it. It's normal. Just remember today is your day to shine! So we gonna be scared? (as Biff) No, Bufie! (as himself) Are we gonna be tough? (as Biff) Yes, Bufie! (as himself) So let's see whatcha got! (holding a small hoop) So just like we practiced, jump through the hoop. You can do it, buddy! (He moves the hoop around the fish) Jump through the hoop! (He holds up the bowl) Victory! 
(Cut to Candace who is walking around Danville talking on her phone)
Candace: What'm I gonna do, Stace? Jeremy wants to spend time with me, but the best thing I could come up with is the mall! That's how boring I am!
(Cut to Stacy)
Stacy: Well, there's a lot more interesting things to do. At least, that's what my mom says.
(Cut back to Candace by a newsstand)
Candace: The café, movie theater...it just all seems so...so ordinary. I just gotta find something cool to do to get me outta my rut. Wanna come along?
(Cut back to Stacy as it is revealed she's standing in front of the mall)
Stacy: Nah, I'm sticking to the mall. It's air-conditioned.

(Cut back to the giant water ball)
Phineas: On your marks, (close up to reveal Holly, Baljeet and Django about to start a race) get set, (blows whistle)...
(The three swim down the ball)
Phineas: Spherical laps! How cool is that? (Ferb gives a thumbs up)
(While the three are racing, the ball begins to move)
Phineas: Awesome! The momentum from the swimming action is causing us to roll! Looks like we're takin' this pool party on the road!
(Everyone cheers as the ball continues to roll down the street.)
Phineas: Hey, you know what? We can totally steer this thing if we paddle opposite the direction that we wanna go!
Isabella: Seems counter-intuitive, but okay.
Phineas: Full speed ahead, Ferb!
(Cut to reveal Ferb back on the jet ski, now joined by Django and Holly also on their own jet skis.)
Phineas: Bumpy street! Dead ahead! (Cut to a street sign that says, "Bumpy St 3300". ) And hang a right onto Zigzag Street! (The water ball zigzags on the zigzag shaped road.) Woah! Loop-de-Loop Street!
(A man falls from a house at the top of the loop)
Man: At least it's rent-controlled! (Crash!) I'm okay. Happens all the time. 
(Cut back to D.E.I.)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, a few more tweaks and I'm ready to double down on some negatives! (Perry escapes from his trap and hits Doofenshmirtz on the head with the chair.) Woah I— (Perry jumps on Doofenshmirtz) That double negative did not make a positive! Ow! Oh, you are gonna get it now! (They run into each other but miss. Doofenshmirtz lands on the controls.) Oh no n-n-no! Now it's stuck in random fire mode! Don't know why I put that mode on there. 
(Cut to Danville Park where Balthazar and three others are playing a game.)
Girl 1: Not it!
Girl 2: Not it!
Boy: Not it!
(Balthazar gets zapped.)
Balthazar: Not not it!
Boy: Get him!
(The others jump on him.) 
(Cut to the courthouse where Major Monogram is announcing the verdict.)
Major Monogram: We, the members of the jury, find the defendant (gets zapped) not not guilty, so I guess we find him guilty. (The bailiff cuffs the defendant and takes him away.) Funny, I coulda sworn he was innocent. 
(Cut to a road construction site. A guard blows a whistle and then sees the giant ball of water.)
Guard: Hey, can't you see the detour? This is not a through street. (gets zapped) Like I said, it's not not a through street.
(The giant ball of water goes through the not through street.) 
(Cut to Candace outside an Electric Salsa dance class building throwing away her Carmen Miranda costume but still wearing her fruit hat.)
Candace: Ugh! This isn't extraordinary! It's just embarrassing!
Phineas: (offscreen) Hey, Candace!
(The giant ball of water rolls by.)
Candace: Phineas and Ferb?!
Linda: (offscreen) Thanks, Bobbi. (cut to reveal Linda coming out of Bobbi's Hair Salon) I'll see ya next week.
Candace: (smiles) Mom! (runs up to her) Mom, Mom, Mom!!
Linda: Candace, what on earth is on your head?
Candace: Nevermind that! Phineas and Ferb are rolling through town on a giant ball of water! Come on! (She grabs hold of her mother and runs, while the fruit hat falls off her head, just like her mother predicted.)
Linda: What about your fruit hat?! 
(Cut to the Danville Fish Show. We see three tables, one with Mandy, Thaddeus and Thor with their fish, one with Rodney and his fish, and one with Buford and Biff, as well as a judges' table.)
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our next contestants: Rodney von Roddenstein and his pet piranha, Fluffy, with their hoop trick!
(Fluffy jumps and seemingly chops his owner's hand off. Rodney's hand suddenly seems to grow back.)
Rodney: Tada!
Announcer: What a terrific new twist to a timeless old trick. Let's see what the judges have to say. (The judges put up their scores, 9, 8, and 9) Wow! That puts Rodney and Fluffy in the lead (Cut to Rodney who reveals he had a false hand) and almost impossible to beat! Next up are Buford and his pet goldfish, Biff, with their version of the hoop jump trick. (Buford smiles nervously) Good luck, toppin' that one, guys!
Buford: Okay, Biffy, we're up! (The ground starts to shake) Jump through the—
(Wide shot of the competition as the giant ball of water rolls through it taking the audience, judges, and contestants with it. Cut to Buford as Biff jumps out of his fishbowl. Cut to the public art from "Bubble Boys".)
Baljeet: Oh no! Public art! Right ahead!
Isabella: It must be part of the Public Art Relocation Program!
(Everyone screams as the water ball goes to the points. Buford swims up to follow Biff. The water ball pops as all the water splashes into a giant hole in the ground. Buford's arm comes out holding the hoop, which Biff successfully jumps through. The judges come out of the water with their scores: all tens.)
Buford: You did it, Biff! We're number one!
Phineas: Congrats, guys!
Buford: Thanks! I'm gonna put Biff's prize money in a scholarship fund for that fancy fish school in the Maldives! 
(Cut to Candace pulling Linda towards the water.)
Candace: Wait until you see this giant ball of water!
Phineas: (offscreen) Hi, guys!
(Point of view shot from Candace at the river; the kids are here.)
Phineas: Come on in! The water's great!
Linda: You're right, Candace. There is a "giant ball of water". Though most people prefer to call it a lake. (walks away)
Jeremy: (enters) Wow! A party in the lake? I never would have thought of that! You come up with the best ideas! We can go to the mall tomorrow.
Candace: You really want to go to the mall again?
Jeremy: We're teenagers. It's what we do. 
(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz and Perry in their fight.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ha! Ya mi— Ow! (falls backwards breaking a table with water and cupcakes on it) That was refreshing. (Perry puts his foot on a button on the controls and an explosion is seen from the building. Perry makes his escape on his parachute.) Ah, that was not not the self-destruct button. (Cut back to Doofenshmirtz in the mess in his lab.) Ugh! Well, oh, man, once again, the place is trashed! You just take off, leaving me here to clean it all up. (Putting on an apron and getting a broom and dustpan) Does it ever occur to you, Perry the Platypus, how much of a mess is left after one of our little tête-à-têtes? I betcha it never even occurred to you that I keep talking to you for a while after you've gone! I mean, it's probably a sad commentary on my life that I'm wearing an apron and talking to a platypus that's no longer...How long have you been standing there, Vanessa?
Vanessa: (offscreen) Long enough, Dad. 
(Scene opens up in the Flynn-Fletcher house kitchen)
Stacy: (from inside) Croutons, bouillon, platypus food... (Cut to her, looking in a pantry.) Ooh! Microwave popcorn! Need this.
Candace: And I have sodas. What else do we wanna bring over your house?
Stacy: Doesn't matter. I doubt we'll not be able to eat while we're watching this movie.
Candace: The Grievance. So scary no one over the age 45 will even watch it!
Stacy: It will be even scarier 'cause my family's out for the day and we will be alone at the house.
Candace: Great!
Stacy: Candace, are you sure you can handle this? (They go out to the backyard.) It took me four days to pry you out from under the bed last time we saw a scary movie. (outside) What? What are you looking at? Oh no.
Candace: Phineas and Ferb! What are you guys up to?
Phineas: It's a surprise for Isabella's birthday!
Candace: A surprise...
Stacy: Here we go again.
Candace: ...for Isabella's...
Stacy: Give me those sodas. (She grabs the sodas Candace was holding)
Candace: ...birthday.
Stacy: See ya. (She walks off)
Phineas: Building supplies? Check. Guest list? Check. Perry? Hey, where's Perry?
Stacy: (Still leaving) Yeah, where does that platypus go every day? 
(In Perry's lair everything is dark except for the Major Monogram on the screen.)
Major Monogram: Agent P.? (The lights flicker on) Ah, there you are. What do you think of the new motion sensor lights we've installed in your lair. (The lights go off again) Um... Agent P. try flailing your arms about that should- (Agent P. does so and the lights turn on) There we go! Now, Doofenshmirtz has been driving around town in some sort of truck that turns inanimate objects, like parking meters, into bugs. Eww. I want you to-- (The lights go off in where Major Monogram is) Really? Carl, I'm waving my arms, why aren't the lights coming back on?
(Carl laughs evilly)
Major Monogram: That's not funny, Carl. 
(In the backyard Ferb, Candace, Buford, Adyson, Gretchen, Katie, Milly, and Holly listen to Phineas.)
Phineas: Okay, time to commence operation INAP.
Adyson: (To Candace) That stands for Isabella's Natal Anniversary Party.
Candace: I know what INAP means. Just get to the dangerous part I'm readying the phone.
Phineas: Okay everyone, we need to carry all this stuff over to Isabella's backyard, so we can set it up for--
Isabella: Hi, Phineas. What'cha doooin'? You're not planning something for my birthday, are you?
Phineas: Don't look, don't look, don't look! Nothing to see here.
Isabella: Phineas! But all I really want for my birthday is-
Phineas: Don't ruin the surprise! (He laughs nervously) Buford, get her out of here.
Buford: You got it. (He throws a bag over Isabella and carries her out)
Isabella: But what I real-
Buford: I've carried a lot of squirmin' bags in my time, but this is the first time I knew who was in it. (He walks off)
Isabella: Augh! What I was going to say was all I want for my birthday is some alone time with-- (motions to Phineas) Never mind. (She walks out)
Baljeet: You wanted to be alone with this bag?

Phineas and kids: Happy birthday, Isabella! 
(Perry chases after Doofenshmirtz's trucks, and uses a wooden ramp he packed, he launches himself on top of the truck)
Doofenshmirtz: Perry the platypus? It's no use trying to break through my protective bubble. It's platyproof-poof. I mean, oh you know what I mean. Anyway, you're probably wondering what I'm doing, driving this evil bug bus around town. I just got to thinking about all the things that bug me. Portable outhouses, high voltage signs. "Danger High Voltage". I'll decide how much voltage I can take! That's why I created the Bugs-me-inator. It turns whatever bugs me into bugs. And, since I can't stand bugs, I'm protected from them inside this bubble. (Perry points to a bug inside Doofenshmirtz's bubble) Huh? Oh, that's on the outs-- Ow! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! (Doofenshmirtz open the bubble to let the bugs out) Wait I'm not ready! (Perry punches him, causing him to spin around his bubble) Whoa, whoa whoa. Right to the point huh? You know Perry the Platypus, more than anything, you bug me. (He fires the -inator at Perry, who dodges it, making the beam, instead, hit one of Doofenshmirtz's shoes) Ah! My shoe! Ow Get off! Get off! Get off! Ow! (Doofenshmirtz launches himself at Perry, but Perry redirects him back into his bubble, spinning him again.) Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Boy I really got to rethink the design on this thing. By the way, you know we're on a runaway bus careening at high speed with no one at the wheel, right? 
Stacy: (To the movie) Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. He went in there. Oh, gross she brought thousands of tiny bugs into the house. What could be worse than that? (Doofenshmirtz's bus crashes into Stacy's house) Big bug! Ahhh! (Stacy hides behind the couch) OMG! Perry! What are you doing here?! And why are you wearing a hat? Look out! (Doofenshmirtz flies onto the couch) And who's this pharmacist?
Doofenshmirtz: Really? Really? W-why does everyone just stampede to that conclusion? Other people wear lab coats you know. Why, why don't you say, "Oh look a rocket scientist." Or a veterinarian?
Stacy: Are you a veterinarian?
Doofenshmirtz: No... But that's not the point. 
Phineas: Check it out. (Isabella's massive cake is seen being wheeled in.) We made your favorite, a red velvet cake, with a little surprise.
Baljeet: Ooh, I hope they do not have a male dancer popping out of it.
Buford: They asked, but they couldn't afford me.
Phineas: Will you do the honors Ferb? (Ferb presses a button, and the candles light.)
Phineas: (To Isabella) Make a wish.
Isabella: (In her thoughts) I wish for time alone with Phineas.
(She blows out the candles, and streamers and confetti pop out)
Holly: (To Candace) What are you doing?
Candace: Waiting for things to get dangerous, so I can my mom to come bust the boys.
Holly: That's not dangerous?
Candace: Dude, this is nothing, it'll get worse.
(Back on top of the cake)
Phineas: So, did you get what you wished for?
Isabella: Uh-
Buford: Yeah, it's every girls wish to have her backyard covered in litter. Let's go you two. Next event.
Phineas: You're gonna love this. 
Stacy: Is this where you go every day Perry?
Doofenshmirtz: (While fighting Perry) Oh yeah, pretty much. I create -inators, and he breaks in and thwarts my scheme, and it's, it's kinda our thing. (Perry knocks Doofenshmirtz to the ground) Ooh! The Grievance! I saw this in theaters. I still have nightmares about the greasy little girl who comes out of the base--
Stacy: (Still behind the couch) No! Don't tell me how it ends! 
Phineas: And, now, what's a birthday party without a piñata the size of your house? Ferb? Hit it. (Ferb breaks the giant piñata with a giant bat, releasing smaller ones for everyone else to hit.)
Ginger: Woohoo!
Adyson: I'm gonna bash this thing!
Gretchen: Give up the candy, yo!
Holly: (Still speaking with Candace) This isn't dangerous enough?
Candace: We're getting there.
Baljeet: Isabella, this must be your best birthday ever.
Isabella: (A little sadly) Yeah, sure. It's super cool. I didn't need--
Buford: Okay Birthday girl, onto the next. (He throws a bag over her, and deposits her at her pool) 
Phineas: Gather 'round everyone, and keep your eyes on the pool. Isabella, it's grand finale time! (He pulls a lever, and the pool begins to shake.)
Holly: Um? This might be the time to call.
Candace: Yep! (She dials Linda) Mom? You've got to come across the street immediately.
(The structure continues to rise out of the pool, which is only seen as a shadow rising over the guests.)
Kids: Ooh!
Milly: What a grand, and glorious, and potentially bustable gift!
Adyson: I've never seen anything like it! 
Linda: That key? That key?
Candace: Mom! Mom!
Linda: Here, grab these will ya?
(She passes the groceries off to Candace.)
Candace: Mom, you've got to see what the boys are doing in Isabella's yard!
Linda: Isabella's yard? That's a new one. 
Stacy: Alright, look. You're getting oil all over the place. Someone's going to have to-- (Stacy trips, and falls in the pool of oil.)
Doofenshmirtz: No! It's the greasy Grievance girl from the basement! No! No! What have I done? Why do you have a grievance against me? (Doofenshmirtz screams, and jumps out the window)
Stacy: (Fixing her hair) Whoa. What was that all about? Do the Flynn Fletchers know you fight evil scientists? (Stacy accidentally steps on the remote firing the -inator, and Perry whacks it with a bat, destroying it. The -inator beam bounces off a satellite and heads back towards Earth.) 
Candace: Back here, Mom.
(The -inator beam hits Isabella's gift, turning it into butterflies just as Candace enters.)
Isabella: Butterflies? I love butterflies! Oh, thank you Phineas!
Phineas: (Confused at how the gift turned to butterflies) What?
Candace: But, but, but, but, but... Butterflies?!
Linda: Oh, how beautiful! How long did it take you guys to collect them all? 
(At Stacy's house, Monogram shows up, disguised as a Danville Water and Power employee)
Major Monogram: Let's go boys, looks like we've got some cleaning up to do. Alright you and you begin with the pavement area around here. And you... (Monogram rings the doorbell) Danville Water and Power. We're here to read your gas thingy.
(Perry leads Stacy outside)
Stacy: Perry? What is all this? (Perry hands Stacy a pamphlet) A-a host family, mind erasing, balloon coverup? I mean is all this really necessary? (Perry shrugs) Wait a minute! It says right here in your silly little pamphlet that if your host family finds out about your agent status, then anyone who's seen you has to have their memory erased, or you'll get relocated. Perry, I'm not part of your host family! I know, I know, it's a technicality. Look, I don't want Candace and the boys to lose you, but I also do not want my mind erased. I'm on the last ten minutes of that Grievance movie, and I don't want to have to watch that whole scary mess again. So, uh, can we just keep this a secret? (Perry smiles and tips his hat to Stacy)
Carl: Luckily Sir, it looks like the residents were not home.
Stacy: (At the front door) Hello? Uh, anybody there?
Major Monogram: (To Carl) I'll take care of it. (To Stacy) Oh, hello there young teenager. You live here?
Stacy: Yes. I walked home from the mall to find... this. What is happening here?
Major Monogram: Oh, you didn't see what happened? Well, um. We're with the city, and there was a swamp gas incident here. We'll just get it all cleaned up, and get out of your hair. (He turns to Carl) Psst. Hey Carl. We're not going to need the mind erasing device. (He looks back at Stacy) I mean monkey wrench. Hehe. Monkey wrench, we don't need that. 
Katie: Happy birthday, Isabella!
(The Fireside girls begin to leave)
Isabella: Thanks guys!
Phineas: I still can't figure out what went wrong with the grand finale. After the laser light show, and the fireballs, the swans should have been released, and-
Isabella: Phineas, I really liked the butterflies. Thank you.
Phineas: Well to make it up to you, it's kinda lame but... maybe Ferb and I could, I don't know, take you out for some ice cream or something?
Isabella: Uh-
Ferb: I...just remembered there's...something I need to do. You two go.
Phineas: Is that cool?
Isabella: Yes! Very cool. Ferb.
(Isabella fist bumps Ferb.) 
(At the Soda Fountain)
Phineas: So, did you get what you wished for? Oh, yeah, I already asked that. Confetti, and streamers. Hold on, gonna get another napkin. (He goes off)
Isabella: (romantically) And butterflies, you always give me butterflies. 
(The words "Happy New Year!" appear in a twinkling font in the sky; the camera pans down to the Garcia-Shapiros' driveway)
Vivian: Have fun at the party!
Linda: (in her car) Thanks for having the boys over tonight, Vivian.
Vivian: Oh, no problem, Linda. I have all the neighborhood kids tonight.
Candace: (in the back seat of the car) C'mon, c'mon, I don't want to be late for my first grown-up party!
Linda: Heh. Okay, hun. Bye everyone! Happy New Year!
Phineas: Bye guys!
Isabella, Buford, Baljeet, Vivian: Goodbye!
Phineas, Isabella, Buford, Baljeet, Vivian: Happy New Year!
Isabella: We're gonna have so much fun! We've got noisemakers, balloons, confetti...
Vivian: And of course, we'll all stay up till midnight and watch the New Year's Eve ball drop!
Buford: Baljeet's already out! (elbowing Baljeet) Wake up, will ya! You're drooling all over my arm!
Baljeet: You know, saliva is 98% water and the other 2% is made up of very beneficial electrolytes. It is gross, but it is science.
Buford: You're lucky the gross factor outweighs the science factor, or you'd have a one-way ticket to wedgie town!
Phineas: Well, it'll be fun to finally see the ball drop.
Vivian: Oh, it's a wonderful tradition!
Isabella: And, of course, there's the other tradition of kissing someone special at midnight.
Phineas: Well then, I know what we're going to do tonight.
Isabella: Really?
Phineas: Yeah! We're gonna make our own New Year's ball and drop it from outer space!
(Isabella frowns)
Vivian: Your mother is right, Phineas. You have such an active imagination!
Isabella: (dryly) Not active enough.
Vivian: I'm going to make some hot chocolate. You kids come in when you want to warm up. Hey, where's your platypus?
(Perry lifts a patch of ice in the backyard and drops down into his lair)
Major Monogram: (wearing a winter knit cap) Morning, Agent P. Sorry about the cold climate inside your lair; see, the heating system is on the fritz and we had to call a guy in from Aruba, but I can assure you that we are all in the same boat here. (Perry is now completely frozen in ice, except for his bill) You're not alone in this; we are all sharing the pain, and... (a beach ball hits the background, which drops, revealing that Monogram is in Aruba) Heh heh heh, awk-ward.
Carl: Race ya to the wet ski!
Major Monogram: Um, uh, Doof's doing something in City Hall, uh, put a stop to whatever it is. (running after Carl) Hey Carl, I get the blue one!
'(Perry frozenly chatters)
(Scene shifts to the backyard at the Flynn-Fletcher house)
(Song: Quirky Worky Song)
Isabella: Okay, Phineas, we're good to go!
Phineas: Great. Bring her down! How's the soldering going up there?
Baljeet: Ferb is almost done.
Phineas: How are you doing, Buford?
Buford: Why do I have to paint? Painting is for babies and beatniks!
Phineas: That's no ordinary paint. It's a super-sealer that will protect us from the cold, dark vacuum of space!
Buford: Beatnik talk!
Irving: (followed by the Fireside Girls and two other kids, all staring in awe at the ball) Hey, Phineas. Mind if we see the inside?
Phineas: Not at all! (They enter; each room is shown as Phineas mentions it) Check it out! A multi-level New Year's ball with punch bowl sailing...
Isabella: Ahoy!
Phineas: ...balloon room, the bed of a thousand coats, an infinity slide, and through here, the grand ballroom! In other words, a ball within a ball!
Irving: Whoa!
Phineas: Irving?
Irving: (on the infinity slide) How do I get out of here?!
♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! ♪
Norm: Happy New Year!
Doofenshmirtz: Norm, I told you: You don't celebrate 'til midnight, not all day. What if midnight never comes? Then you've squandered a whole day celebrating. Think of that, tough guy? (crashing sound is heard) Perry the Platypus? (the floor opens up below Perry, trapping him in the top of a bottle) Ha-ha! It's a bottle of sparkling cider trap, and you're the cork! Which makes you Perry the Cork-apus! Ha-ha, you got a funny name. Anyway, it's New Year's-themed!
Norm: Happy New Year!
Doofenshmirtz: Not yet, Norm. And on to my plan: I recently learned that in most of the world, there's a tradition where people decide to change something about their lives in the coming year, and they call it "a New Year's resolution." I-I-I had no idea; you see, back in Drusselstein, change was frowned upon. Any change!
(Flashback of young Doofenshmirtz in front of his TV, being closely watched by a guard)
Doofenshmirtz: (voice over) Uh, you couldn't change your channel on your TV,...
(Flashback of young Doofenshmirtz dropping a flower into his pants)
Doofenshmirtz: (voice over) ...you couldn't change your underwear,...
(Flashback of young Doofenshmirtz in jail with two tough-looking criminals)
Doofenshmirtz: (voice over)...and forget about changing your hairstyle; you... you'd end up in jail.
(All three people in jail are shown with odd hairstyles; flashbacks end.) 
Doofenshmirtz: But here in the new world, we embrace change! (beat) Apparently. And that's why I came up with the Resolution Changer-inator! Cleverly disguised as a bow tie! When I turn it on at the stroke of midnight, it will make everyone change their resolution from whatever it was, like, I don't know, "I-I'm gonna lose weight," or, "gain a limb," or whatever, to, "I'm going to make Heinz Doofenshmirtz my leader and obey his every command." That will be their new resolution. (puts the Resolution Changer-inator on) All right, Norm, how do I look?
Norm: Like a pharmacist in a bow tie!
Doofenshmirtz: Eh, good enough. Time to go. (Norm blows a noisemaker) You're squandering, Norm!

Lawrence: (entering the party at City Hall with Linda) Ready to get your party on, dear?
Linda: Do one-legged ducks swim in circles?
Candace: (entering the party with Stacy) Wow, first year with the adults!
Stacy: Yep, we're all grown up now. No more pigtails, dollies, or obsessing over boys.
Candace: From now on, we obsess over men. (Candace and Stacy laugh) And no more busting!
Stacy: Attagirl.
Candace: Yep, I'm sticking to my resolution and turning over a new leaf. Fifteen whole minutes and I haven't thought of Phineas and Ferb. (her eye starts twitching) How they make those things. You know, those big, like, dangerous things they make...
Stacy: Candace...
Candace: Sorry! I'm back, I'm back. Resolution... kicking in. Oh look, here come the boys!
Stacy: You mean men? (Candace and Stacy laugh)
Jeremy: (walking up to them with Coltrane) Ladies.
Stacy: That's us! We're ladies.

Norm: Carbonation is fun!
(Scene shifts back to City Hall)
Doofenshmirtz: (entering the party) Hello, Danville! (running up to a man) Hey you there, what's your New Year's resolution?
Mustached man: To update my mustache.
Doofenshmirtz: That's what you think! (walking away) Ha-HA-ha-ha! HA-ha!
Mustached man: I don't know; it seemed achievable.
Candace: (sitting at a table with Stacy) This is so great, being here as an adult. (giggles) Heh-heh. Not like my brothers. Who are kids. Who are probably building something, and it's something big...
Stacy: Candace...
Candace: Big and bustable... Gotta go!
Stacy: Oh no you don't! This is gonna be a new year with a new Candace! Remember?
Candace: (trying to resist, gripping the table) Gotta bust. G-g-g-gotta-g-g-gotta bu-bu-bu-bust! (breaks off two chunks of the table) Bust!
Stacy: (as Candace keeps chattering) It's okay. It's just a temporary relapse.
Jeremy: (walking up with Coltrane, holding a tray with four glasses of sparkling cider on it) Candace? Stacy told me about your New Year's resolution.
Candace: Iiiiii... I need a timeout. I'll be right back!
Jeremy: Relapse?
Stacy: Relapse.

Linda: Just like the '80s.
Candace: (in the ladies bathroom, washing her face with cold water) Hbrbrbrbrbr... Hold it together, girl. You can do this.
Sandwich woman's friend: Hey, I thought your New Year's resolution was to stop eating sandwiches in the bathroom.
Sandwich woman: (eating a large sandwich) But it's not midnight yet, so I can still enjoy this.
Candace: Not midnight yet? That's it! I've actually got an hour left to bust my brothers! (running out of City Hall) I've gotta find out what they're doing! I'll get video. Whoa! Ooh! (slips and falls on a patch of ice) Aah! Aah!! (skids down an alleyway, bounces off a pillow and goes flying) Aah!!! (swings around a street lamp's pole and lands on her feet) Ooh! Huh, that parkour training actually paid off.

Phineas: All right, let's start this bash in a ball! (pulls a lever)
Kids: Yay! (they all throw confetti)

Doofenshmirtz: (runs through a curtain into a room filled with coats) What is this, the coat room?

Jeremy: Serious relapse.
Candace: Come on, Irving. (plugs her phone into the wall, switching the video feed to show Phineas and Ferb's ball) Yes! Everyone, can I have your attention please? (everyone turns to face Candace) My brothers and their friends will be dropping from outer space in that giant New Year's ball.
Crowd: Wow!
Man: Amazing!
Woman: Ooh, that's fantastic!
Candace: No, that's not fantastic! It, uh, okay, well, I-I admit it's impressive, but it's still bustable! Mooo-oommmm!!
Woman with pearls: If those were my boys, they'd be so busted.
Candace: Please! Adopt me now! AAAUUUGGGHHH! Mom!

Man and woman: (running out of coat room) Only one minute 'til midnight!
Doofenshmirtz: Time to launch my pla-an! (runs on stage) Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
(Perry runs out of coat room, removes the straitjacket, and grabs a chair, charging towards the stage with it; Doofenshmirtz gasps, but Perry merely puts the chair on the stage and sits down. He gestures Doofenshmirtz to continue)

Hey, wha-what about your resolution?
Man with party hat: (laughing) Everyone knows that no one ever keeps their New Year's resolution.
Doofenshmirtz: That doesn't even make any sense! Why would you make resolutions if you're not ever gonna fol... (to Perry) Did you know about this? You did!

Linda: I thought you probably would.

Linda: Not yet. Although they are trying to figure out how they can both use the push broom at the same time.
Candace: OK, keep me posted. (hangs up)

Major Monogram: Ah, Agent P. Special surveillance photos tells us that Doof is outfitting his skiff with something. It's hard to tell--
Carl: (offscreen) Sir, I looked up the window at his building just now, and saw the mysterious object was actually a bucket. A huge bucket.
Major Monogram: (to Carl) Carl!? Why didn't we just look out the window in the first place?

Baljeet: That is very nice! (He walks up a ladder supported by a huge dragon kite as the scene pans out. Chinese music plays.) Have you seen my kite?
Buford: Wow! Is it there even be enough wind for something like that?
Baljeet: There should be, with Phineas's wind amplification device. 
(Cut to the wind amplification device at work, then cut to Phineas and Isabella near it.)
Isabella: So, how does this work again?
Phineas: You start by blowing a bit of wind into the intake funnel. (Phineas inhales, then blows into the funnel. Pan to a tank filled with liquid that looks like water, in which Phineas points at it.) Then we have super cool liquid nitrogen to cool things down. Cold air sinks, until it starts to warm back up again. (Pan to a huge blow torch) And that's where we heat it up with a giant blow torch. And then, as it accelerates, it sucks up more air volume, and eventually blows it out with acceleration. (Pan to a huge funnel that opens up to let wind out. A bird flying into it loses all its feathers and is blown away.)
Isabella: But that was just one big puff of air! How can we fly kites like that?
Phineas: Simple! Irving has volunteered to keep puffing air into the intake. (Irving is seen climbing up a ladder.)
Irving: I've been eating mint all morning! (shows a bunch of mint) You know, so it won't be stinky!
Isabella: That's very thoughtful of you, Irving.

Oh, before I forget, I got you a little lair-warming gift. (Doof gives him a ring box. Perry opens it, and a yellow rope is tied tightly around him.) Ha ha! You fell for the old spring-loaded-cable-trap-hidden-in-a-ring-box trick. What the? Th-that's a thing. Obviously. I bet you're wondering why I'm spying on a garden party. (Cut to Doof.) OK, maybe not wondering, but I'm going to tell you anyway. (Flashback.)
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) It all started when I was a child, back in Drusselstein. There was this mean girl named Grulinda. Every day she would pour water on my head. (Young Grulinda laughs after pouring water over young Doofenshmirtz's head.) No matter where I was, (Young Grulinda again pours water over young Doofenshmirtz's head and laughs.) or what I was doing, (Young Grulinda again pours water over young Doofenshmirtz's head and laughs.)

And the party just started, I don't know how they got this picture in the magazine so quick. Eh, I guess they're trying to compete with the internet. (closes magazine) But, I digress! (cut to a giant bucket of water.) I can finally have my revenge! With this! (turns to Perry) The Sog-inator! (evil laugh) Now I will fly over her party, and douse her, with a lifetime of soggy humiliation! (pause) What? Oh, you think that it's petty that I held onto this grudge for so long. Oh, it's not petty. It's not. (looks at Perry sarcastically) It's evil or something; it's not petty. 
Linda: Okay guys, I'm dying to see what you-- (gets shocked and drops tray of lemonade. The lemonade falls to the ground and breaks. A cat's yowl is heard.) What is that?
(Cut to landscapers and a landscape that looks like a bucket spilling out water.)
Pierre: Well it's not finished yet. But it's juxtaposition of the irrigated world of the suburban lawn the dryness of the natural summer environment. A water bucket dumping desert cacti, honey suckle basket, weak glass handle, extra spiky bubble cacti in place of the water.
Linda: (angrily) That looks- that's- (groans, walks away)

Floraine: Volgens mij vindt ze het niks. ("I don't think she likes it.")
Pierre: Not to worry, great art always takes time before it's accepted.
(Cut to inside of Flynn-Fletcher house. Linda is having a headache, and the telephone rings.)
Linda: Hello?
Candace: Mom, I need you to go into my closet and tell me what--
Linda: (places hand on forehead) Candace, I- look- call me in a few minutes. I'm a little ticked off right now.
Candace: (she gets a surprised expression on her face.) What happened?
Linda: Du Bois made a huge mess in the yard; they ripped off the lawn, there's a giant bucket, and a bunch of catuses. (raises voice in an angry way) I'm so mad! I gotta go.
(scene switches to mall)
Stacy: Candace, what's wrong?
Candace: (weakly, referring to Phineas and Ferb) It's the boys, they're busted. (She falls over.)

(Cut to Danville Park, then pan up to Doofenshmirtz's hovering machine)
Doofenshmirtz: We should be over Grulinda's party any minute. Then it's soggy revenge time! (part of water from giant bucket falls off) Whoa! It's windy up here. If that keeps up, I don't have enough water to dump on her. (Perry thinks for a while, then bumps giant bucket on purpose. He does this one more time.) What? Did you hear that? (Perry just keeps quiet) 
(Cut to Irving about to inhale air, then blows. Drops of water fall on him, then gets sucked in by the intake funnel.)
Irving: Uh oh.
(The amplifier causes the huge amount of water to fly out, causing a great storm.)
Baljeet: Whoa!
Isabella: It's getting a little "rainy".
Buford: A little!
(Cut to inside of car kite with Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella inside.)
Phineas: Looks like we better climb down.
(Cut to pirate ship kite with Baljeet and Buford clinging on to the deck.)
Buford: Just remember, Baljeet, a captain always goes down with the ship. (gives hat to Baljeet)
Baljeet: Oh boy, a promotion. (Buford jumps down, and he realizes.) Hey!
(The gang jumps down, but Baljeet is the last one.) 
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz and his hovering machine.)
Doofenshmirtz: What's that noise? (the huge amount of water splashes onto the machine, causing Doofenshmirtz to hold on to the handle.) What the heck there? You've been dumping out my water? Oh, this had better not not be empty. 
(Cut to Linda with a sarcastic look on her face.)
Pierre: (offscreen) Okay Linda, I know you're gonna love this. (Cut to landscapers standing next to a giant spinning wheel.) This is the irrigation wheel! Each section represents a different section of the garden. (spins wheel) It's a comment on the capricious nature of our existence. (wheel stops spinning, and arrow points on a band of flowers) Some get water and live, others go dry and die!
Linda: (facepalm) This is ridiculous. I don't want to end up with a yard full of (pause) dead plants!
Floraine: Ik heb water in mijn laarzen. ("I've got water in my boots.")
Linda: (with still hand on forehead) What did he say?
Pierre: He said, (angrily) "GREAT ART TAKES TIME!" (normal voice) in Dutch. 
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz and his hovering machine again. Doofenshmirtz is climbing up onto the giant bucket of water using a ladder. Perry goes up onto the handle.)
Doofenshmirtz: Hey, watch it. (falls over) Ugh! Now watch the ailerons! (He falls into bucket again. He climbs out of the bucket. The bucket falls over and crashes onto the wind amplifier. It breaks, causing Doofenshmirtz to fly into the air carried by a huge amount of water. The water shoots into the clouds, and Doofenshmirtz falls back down to earth. Perry tears apart his trap, jumps off, and catches Doofenshmirtz by his left leg. The parachute goes off. As Perry and Doofenshmirtz, the storm clears, but Doofenshmirtz falls off again, and Perry is left with only his left shoe. He lands into a tree, and the tree flings him onto the ground, causing him to roll to Grulinda's party. He stops at a woman's feet, and thinks it is Grulinda.) Oh, you! I almost dumped a giant bucket of water on you and your party. And there was this whole mishap with the platyp- but I will get you next time! Revenge is a dish best served soggy, Grulinda!
Mean Woman: Uh, Grulinda's over there, bub.
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, you're not... (turns to the other person -- the real Grulinda, who is astonishingly beautiful -- and clears throat) All right, Gruuuuuuu...
Grulinda Boubenweir: Wait! Is that... hold on one second. (reaches for glasses and puts them on, then gasps) Soggy bottom Heinz Doofenshmirtz! It is you.
Doofenshmirtz: Wow, you've changed. You used to be so... you know, what's the polite way to say... you know, like this one? (points to mean woman) Ugly.
Mean Woman: Oh oh, you're on my list now, buddy.
Doofenshmirtz: So why are you being so nice to me.
Grulinda: Nice? I don't understand.
Doofenshmirtz: You picked on me all through grade school.
Grulinda: (chuckles) I poured all that water on you, because I liked you.
Doofenshmirtz: Really? We, we, well I guess you must have liked me a lot, 'cause there was a lot of, you know, water.

Pierre: She holds the thorns, which symbolizes the hardships of being a mom, and she holds pink jasmine, which symbolizes the joy of children.
Linda: This, is, the most, (does the puppy eye look) sweet and adorable thing I've ever seen. (walks away)
Pierre: (in a loud and not-so-happy voice) Sweet and adorable? (angrily) She's mocking us!

Grulinda: It is so good to see you after all these years, just look at you! Oh, come here, my little soggy bottom. (hugs Doofenshmirtz)
Doofenshmirtz: Eh, well, eh, now, you hug now.
Grulinda: Oh, why are you all wet?
Doofenshmirtz: He, he, funny thing. I was flying over your party with a giant bucket of water, and this platypus hit me with a--
Grulinda: Why are you flying over my party with a big bucket of water?

Mean Woman: He's gonna dump on you for revenge.
Doofenshmirtz: OK, now you're on my list.
Grulinda: Revenge? For what?
Doofenshmirtz: Well, you know, you did dump water on me when we were little.
(The mean woman walks away.)
Grulinda: Heinz! I was eight! Have you been holding this petty grudge all these years?
(The mean woman reappears with a cup of water.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh no, it's not petty; I was explaining to the platypus earlier; it's not--
Grulinda: (angrily) Well, here you go. I pour water on your head. (pours water on Doof's head. She then throws the cup to Doof, and she and the mean woman walk away.)
(Zoom out to reveal Perry walking to Doof.)
Doofenshmirtz: Wait. Was that for the vengeance thing or do you still like me? (Water is thrown onto Doof. To Perry) Yeah, it was the vengeance thing. (a cup is thrown onto Doof.) 
(Cut to living room where Linda is sitting down reading a book, just as Candace runs to her.)
Candace: (excitedly) Tell me. What are the boys doing at the backyard? How much trouble are they in?
Linda: Well, at first, I thought Du Bois were the world's worst landscapers, but they're growing on me.
Candace: (suddenly surprised) Landscapers?
Linda: Yeah, here, let me show you.
(Cut to the gang in the backyard.)
Phineas: So I figure we can attach the seat right here--
Candace: (offscreen) There they are, Mom. (onscreen) Show me what they did.
Phineas: (confused) What did who do?
(Cut to Linda.)
Linda: Whoa, wait. Where did it all go?
Candace: (sarcastically) Ha ha.
Linda: (surprisingly) How is that even possible?
Candace: Very funny, Mom.

Linda: It was all here just a second ago.

Floraine: Would you rather I spoke in English?
Pierre: Well yeah, now that you mentioned it, yeah.
(Cut to truck driving away.) 
(Opens showing the Flynn-Fletcher house, then the camera cuts to Phineas, Ferb and the gang in the backyard.)
Phineas: Come on gang, let's get started on building our megamondo--
Buford: Eh, no can do, Dinner Bell! It's family day, and the Van Stomms from the low countries are visiting. (walks away) Buford is out, G!
Phineas: Well that's a bummer. But we can come over some workarounds. (to Isabella and Baljeet) So if you two--
Baljeet: No can do, Phineas. I am taking an eastern Indian cooking class. We are going to make goat vindaloo. If we can ever find a goat. (goat brays offscreen) Oh! There is one now. Gotta run! (runs away)
Phineas: Well, good luck! (pauses) Well the plans will still work with just three of us.
Linda: (walks up) I'm afraid your plans will have to wait until after Ferb's dental appointment. (walks Ferb with her) Come on, honey, time to go!
Ferb: All right.
(They exit.)
Phineas: Wow, I've never seen Ferb so nervous. Hmm. Well I guess it's just the two of us, huh. (Isabella squeals excitedly with an exaggerated smile on her face.) Isabella, are you all right?
Isabella: (slaps herself, acting normal) Oh. Oh yeah. We can spend the day together, that'll be fun! Whatever.
Phineas: Let's see; with only two of us, we'd have to reallocate some weight in order to... (pause) Huh. Well, maybe if we just reduce the amount of... (sighs) No, that won't fly either. Y'know, this is a lot harder without Ferb around.
Isabella: But he never says anything.
Phineas: It's not what he doesn't say, it's how he doesn't say it.
Isabella: Well I can get the Fireside Girl Manual for inspiration.
Phineas: That sounds great! Thanks.
(Isabella runs off)
Phineas: Wow! Even Perry's gone... but that's pretty normal.

Major Monogram: I see you've taken our new breakfast-themed lair entrance. It's the most important lair entrance of the day. Anyhoo, OWCA has surveillance footage of Doofenshmirtz raiding thrift-store dollar bins. Not sure if it's evil, but it's, just kind of pathetic. Get to the bottom of this, and stop Doof's potential poverty-driven criminal freakout. And um, how 'bout ya pick up a cup of coffee for him on your way over? It's on me. Use some petty cash. (Perry salutes, then leaves) I feel bad for the poor guy. 
(Cut to the Fireside Girls lodge, then to a red telephone under a glass lid on a podium. It rings.)
Gretchen: (offscreen, gasps) The Fireside Phone!
(On the end of this, Gretchen and Ginger rush up, the latter takes off the glass lid, the former answers the phone.)
Gretchen: Gretchen at the ready, ma'am! Commence debriefing!

Isabella: Gretchen, we have a Code Pink! Romeo is alone! Repeat: Romeo is alone!
(Cut back to Gretchen.)
Gretchen: Roger that. Don't panic, we're on our way.
(Cut back to Isabella as she puts her phone away. Gretchen is suddenly standing next to her.)
Gretchen: (saluting) Reporting for duty, ma'am.
(Isabella blinks twice in confusion.) 
(Flip to Gretchen leading Isabella to Holly, who is blowing up an inflatable Fireside Girls clubhouse.)
Gretchen: The troop is establishing the mobile tactical headquarters as we speak!
Isabella: Nice hustle. (She and Gretchen walk inside.)
(Holly pulls a cord, and an inflatable tree blows up next to the clubhouse.) 
(Cut to Candace, walking in the street on her phone with her eyes closed.)
Candace: I know, right? With Phineas and Ferb split up for the day, it's practically a vacation! (She passes by Isabella's house with the clubhouse next to it in the background.) Yes, I know we're already on summer vacation, Stace. I was just -- (Opens her eyes and turns around, notices the clubhouse) What? A Fireside Girls mobile tactical unit? Sorry, Stace, gotta go! (Hangs up and runs off.) 
(Cut to inside the clubhouse, Candace barges the door open.)
Candace: Okay, what are you doing (Walks up to Isabella and Gretchen) and what has to do with my brothers?
Isabella: Um... (Scoffs, cut to the other girls working on a scale model on a table, continues offscreen) it's...something of a delicate matter.
Milly: Romeo is all go!
Candace: Delicate?
Isabella: Well, you might not know, but I have a little bit of crush on Phineas.
Ginger: (offscreen) Little being subjective.
Isabella: (dryly) Stand down, Fireside Girl.
Candace: (realizing) Totally get the crush thing! You know, I don't quite get the Phineas thing. I mean, you do realize his head is a triangle.
Isabella: (Sighs, romantically) Yeah, it's so acute!
Candace: Whatever. I have got your back, sister. I will stay outta the yard, and keep Mom out of the way too. (Folds her arms) Like, that should be difficult. 
(Cut to the exterior of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated as the Evil Jingle doorbell rings. Cut to inside, Perry is outside the door to Doofenshmirtz's apartment, holding a coffee cup. The door opens, Doofenshmirtz comes out, having a 5:00 shadow on his face.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, it's you, Perry the Platypus. (Perry presents him the coffee cup.) What? Oh, for me? (He takes it.) Oh, that's a nice gesture, thanks. (Perry walks inside.) A-and you even used the doorbell instead of just crashing through, like you usually do. Alright, really appreciate this, Perry the Platypus, 'cause you know, money's a little tight lately, I can't even rub two nickles together. (Cut to Perry standing on a white patch of floor, he continues offscreen) Although if I had two nickles, I don't think I could sit and rub them together. (While saying this, Perry stares at the screen, then eventually sinks into the floor.) Oh, oh yeah, you're trapped, Perry the Platypus, (Cut to him) it's quick hardening, non-dairy creamer. Like I said, I'm on a budget. I know what you're thinking, Perry the Platypus, how could this happen to such a (Close-up of a stern Perry, he continues offscreen) with-it guy like Heinz Doofenshmirtz? (Cut to him) Well, my ex-wife Charlene is out of the country on one of those...Extreme Eco-cultural Exploration Vacations. I -- I don't know what they do on those trips, but I imagine it's (crossfade to a still image of Charlene zip-lining with money flying out of her pocket, he continues offscreen) very expensive. (dissolve to her kayaking) Ugh, she's got some nerve! (cut to her hula dancing) That's -- that's my alimony she's throwing away! (cut back to he and Perry, he's showing him the images on his phone) And the worst is, she keeps texting me these pics! (puts it in his pocket, it beeps and vibrates) Oh, come on, really?! (walks offscreen) Anyway, the problem is I've already spent this month's alimony on my new -inator and -- (cut to him walking towards his new inator) and now I don't have enough money left to send Vanessa to the Grievance movie marathon she wants to see, and they're playing all the Grievance movies in order. They've got The Grievance, they've got Grievance 2: The Gripe, Grievance 3: Bone To Pick, and Grievance 4: The Revenge of the Italian Jug Band. You know, I don't think that last one is canon. Oh, what kind of father am I? Oh, oh, the shame is overwhelming, I can't even enjoy using my new Teleport-inator! (Music sting plays, ominous timpani follows) Nah, nah, I'm just not in the mood. Maybe tomorrow.
(Cut to a radio broadcast room where The Slacks stop playing the music)
Doofenshmirtz: And it was such a stellar plan, too. I was gonna use it to send City Hall, and consequently my brother Roger, back to Drusselstein, and out of his mayoral jurisdiction. No fuss, no muss, just bzzt, and he's gone, instantly. (Cut to Perry, who counts down on his fingers.) Ugh, if only if it were that easy to get Vanessa to the movie theater, wait -- (Perry points at him.) hey, wait a second! (looks at the giant dial on the inator) I could just add another setting to my Teleport-inator and send Vanessa directly to the theater, and completely bypass those ridiculously inflated movie ticket prices. Oh man, am I good! That deserves a victory sip. (drinks coffee) Egh! Wait—what is this, decaf? (cut to a put-out Perry) It's like you don't even know me!

(Cut to outside, Isabella opens the Fireside Girl Manual.)
Isabella: Here we go. Let's just take a look -- (gets a thoughtful look, sounds like a valley girl) You know, I'm kinda hungry.
Phineas: Well then, why not just have a picnic?
Isabella: (acting) Well. What a great idea! And I just happen to have... (shows picnic basket, singy-songy) a picnic basket right here!
(Cut to Gretchen at the computer.)
Gretchen: Ooh, she's good!
(Cut back to Phineas.)
Phineas: Wow! Way to be prepared, Isabella!
Isabella: (acting) Just doing my Fireside Girl thing! I packed it with some Mexican-Jewish delicacies like... (she shows a cheesecake like meal with a gelatin fish head.) gefilte-flan! (close up of it) It wobbles.

Isabella: Nope!

Ginger: (salutes) Mission accomplished!

Irving: Hello, ladies! (purrs)

Doofenshmirtz: The fox hops over the log...the rabbit crawls under the log... (ties wires in a bow, closes compartment) okay, got it! Now, to send -- (falls off) Ahem. And now, to send my daughter to the movies! (horror music plays) Aw, you see, it's just doesn't work in this instance. You know what, you guys just take the rest of the day off.

Slack #1: Want to go see a movie?
Slack #2: Yeah, sure. How about Grievance 4?

Doofenshmirtz: Hey Vanessa, Pumpkin Pants. Can you come in here for a second? (turns knob, Vanessa enters) Good news, sweetie, I can send you to the movies after all!
Vanessa: Really? Dad, it's no big deal.

(Perry hops over to the table and grabs the cup.) And by business, (Perry takes the lid off the cup) I mean evil. (Perry pours the coffee on the creamer block, melting it.) It's time to set my sights on (Cut back to him) on City H -- (Perry kicks him, he slides down the inator.)

Dentist: Ah, here we are. (turns around, sees that Ferb's gone) Gladys, we have a runner.
(Cut back to the backyard, Phineas opens the picnic basket. Isabella yawns, then leans over. She ends up putting her arm around Ferb, who has appeared. She looks up at Ferb, gasps, and inches away, just as Phineas looks up.)
Phineas: Hey, Ferb! You're back! (Ferb doesn't say anything.) Brilliant! (to Isabella) See what I mean, Isabella?
Isabella: (acting, sounds a bit sad) Yeah, it's how he doesn't say it.
Phineas: Let's get to work, this'll be the biggest picnic ever! (walks off) I'll get the tools!
Isabella: (into her earpiece) Alright girls, Union Jack is back. Operation: Perfect Picnic is now Operation: Ginormous Non-romantic Overblown Picnic.
Ferb: (with his mouth full of procaine) Ab flabahem abla flapabla.
Isabella: It's alright, big guy. You guys just do what you do.
Phineas: (runs into the scene, blueprints in hand) Looks like we're gonna need a change of venue. How 'bout the park? 
(Cut to Doofenshmirtz and Perry's fight. Perry gets zapped by the Teleport-inator and disappears.)
Doofenshmirtz: What do you know? No more Perry the Platypus. Transported to some random location somewhere. (Perry reappears and punches his nose, he disappears.) Ow! What -- (Perry reappears behind him, grabbing his head.) OW!! OWEY! 
(Cut to Candace and Vanessa walking away from the theater, which was showing "Ducky Momo Festival".)
Vanessa: Thanks for introducing me to the ironic enjoyment of Ducky Momo, Candace.
Candace: Ironic, yeah. Ha ha. So, your dad was really raised by wild ocelots?
Vanessa: O.M.G., I wish that was (Candace suddenly stops walking and stares in shock.) the weirdest thing about my family. (Close up on Candace.) Candace?

Phineas: So this rock climbing wall will be big! And, best of all, it'll be built of all-natural, an 100% organic, free-range yard trimmings!
Baljeet: So is it only rock climbing wall?
Phineas: No, it's not only rock climbing wall. It's free-range organic rock climbing wall!
Baljeet: I can see how that would be relevant if we are going to eat it. We are not going to have to eat it, are we?!
Phineas: I guess if we had to we could... (Buford enters the picture and closes Baljeet's mouth)
Buford: Did I hear we're building something we can eat?
(Baljeet gets Buford's hand out his mouth)
Baljeet: You know, for the record, I would like to not be in a position today, where I have to eat this wall.
Phineas: We'll see what we can do, but we're not making any promises. 
(In the kitchen Linda sits in a chair near to table where Lawrence washes the dishes. Linda's carrying a paper list in a hand and carefully watching to it. Candace enters the kitchen)
Candace: Mom, have you seen my other white skirt? (Looks at the list) What are those charts?
Linda: Hon, the rare and elusive, bent-bill knot-hatch is in its nest building season. The birds will be done traveling North, and should be right here in town today!
Candace: Snores-ville.
Lawrence: No dear, the bird took a left at Snores-ville, and is up here in Danville. Can I get up high? (Candace high-fives Lawrence)
Linda: Woo! Okay, more specifically, it should be right in our backyard at exactly four today! Isn't that exciting!?
Candace: Wait wait wait wait wait! So you and a bunch of trained observers are going to be in our yard at exactly four in the P.M. today?
Linda: Well, yes.
Candace: Love it! The Booby-hatched trash-nut whatever it is, is my new favorite bird! This is awesome, see you guys later.
Linda: (To Lawrence) See? She thinks it's fun.
Lawrence: Oh, yes and I'm British, and so you think I'm supposed to like bird watching. (Imitating a British accent) Oh, I'm British, so I'll in the conservatory with tea and a crumpet. I'm saying that ironically but actually that sounds quite good. So I'm going to do that. Ta. 
Candace: (outside in the backyard) Oh yeah. Yeah. This looks good. So how long 'till you're done with this contraption? Think you'll still be out here at four?
Phineas: I don't know. I guess so.
Isabella: (sadly) Hi Phineas. Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Hey Isabella, rock climbing wall.
Isabella: Well, I just came by to tell you that I can't join in on the fun today. I've been charge of the task of recording the audio book version of the Fireside Girls Compendium Guide, it's gonna take forever.
Baljeet: That book does not look so intimidating.
Isabella: Dude! This is just the table of contents. The actual book is being transported from a secret bunker to a recording studio at the Fireside Girls Lodge. (The book is seen being air-lifted into the lodge) Seriously, this is going to take me a week.
Phineas: Hey, we can help. We'll just put this rock climbing wall off 'till tomorrow.
Candace: Wait. What? No! You guys keep working, I'll narrate the audiobook. (To Isabella) You stay here and help the boys. Not only will I finish recording your book today, I'll do it by four o'clock.
Isabella: So, let me get this straight; You'll do all the work, while I spend the day with Phineas? Mmm.... Deal. But do you know anyone who can work a state-of-the-art soundboard? Someone who can edit huge digital files? Someone who can understand basic mic-ing techniques?
(Irving slowly peeps over the side of a fence and emits small squealing noises)
Candace: (annoyed) What is it, Irving?
Irving: Okay, I'll do it. But only if Isabella says "where's Perry?"
Candace: No deal.
Irving: You drive a hard bargain, I admit.
Isabella: It's okay, I was about to ask that anyway! 
(Perry jumps into his water bowl, and enters his lair)
Major Monogram: Ah, Agent P. we're getting reports that there is a distinct smell of confectioner sugar, and icing coming form Doofenshmirtz's building. He must be up to something evil and sweet. Sweet and evil. "Sweevil" if you will. Go and stop him.
♪ Perry! ♪ 
Irving: ...and put your headphones on. Fireside Girls Compendium, page one, and take one. Whenever you're ready.
Candace: Ma May Me Mo Mu. Topeka, Kansas. Topeka, Kansas. (Cut to reveal those are the actual words printed in the book.) Man this is the worst book dedication ever. How we doing in there Irving?
Irving: Levels are fine. 
(Song: "The Fireside Girls" (instrumental))
Candace: Page one. Welcome Fireside girl. You're about to embark on a trans-formative journey that you will remember for years to come. (Later) ...and water should be boiled. Now on to part two of the introduction. (Later still) (hoarsely) Section 12, part 6. How to start a fire using only bobby pins and a hat. (Even later) Section 25, part 16. How to tell if a marshmallow is properly roasted. (Candace stumbles, and coughs dryly.)
Irving: Can I get you some water?
Candace: Maybe. (She glances at the clock) N-Keep it rolling, keep it rolling. (She continues) Beginning Section 25, part 17. 
Phineas: Okay, gang. Is everybody all strapped into their harness.
Baljeet: Ready! But it is also the worst wedgie I have ever had.
Buford: Oh really?
Baljeet: Present company excluded.
Phineas: All righty then. Let's go.

Doofenshmirtz: Why if it isn't Perry the Platypus. And when I say "isn't" I mean "is". I know you're into martial arts. But I prefer the confectionery arts myself. (A gingerbread house falls on Perry) Gingerbread house trap. (Peeking through a window in the house)
(Song: "We Wish You A Merry Christmas" (Evil jingle version, instrumental))
Doofenshmirtz: Hey it looks a lot bigger on the inside than it does on the outside. Here, have some cozy gumdrop slippers. Hehehe. Now where was I? Oh yeah. I think I know why I'm having a hard time taking over the Tri-State Area It's because of dinner parties. Follow me, it goes somewhere. You see my brother Roger is a success, because of his amazing dinner parties, where he dazzles important guests, with his magnetic charm. But what if he were unable to charm anyone, because his fabulous dinner parties were over, before they began!? That's why I created this: the Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator! You see everyone knows that once the dessert comes out, the party's over. T-That's what's called a social cue. This rocket will go into a Rogercentric orbit around his house. At the wrong moment it will shoot a blast which will make Roger bring out the dessert. Ending his dinner party before it can begin. He'll lose his charming edge, and people will lose interest, in him. Bing-Bang-Boom. They'll stop voting for him, and that's when I'll slink in and takeove—You know, I know I'm grasping at straws here, and ugh. I'll probably end up grasping a bendy-straw, and fall on my face, requiring months of rehab to learn how to monologue, all over again (Perry throws one of the gumdrop shoes at the Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator, hitting Doofenshmirtz with the ray) and off to empowerment camp, where I'll have to fall backwards—Who want's desserts? (Doofenshmirtz goes off and grabs a few desserts) I made this lovely tiramisu. Heeey... It works! Oh you think you're very funny Perry the Platypus, blasting me with my own Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator. (Perry throws his other shoe at the -inator) Oh-ho-ho. I hope you left some room! I made a yummy double layered pumpkin cheesecake it has creamy—Oh! You got me again. Well you made me bring it to you, so you're going to eat it. (Doofenshmirtz shoves a dessert at Perry, who bites Doofenshmirtz's hand) Ow! (Perry's cage breaks, but the -inator zaps him) Haha. Now it's your turn to bring out the-- (Perry leaps toward Doofenshmirtz, and he smashes the tiramisu into his mouth, sending them both flying back into the kitchen) 
(Song: "Weaponry" (instrumental))
Doofenshmirtz: How about a banana split? (He shove a banana split down Perry's bill) Haha! Finally got your just desserts. What are you doing with that pound cake? I was saving that for company! (Perry forces Doofenshmirtz to eat the entire pound cake) Oh! Oh wow! Perry the Platypus, I'm getting such a sugar rush! How 'bout you? (Perry is shown to be having a sugar rush as well) 
Candace: (in a hoarse voice) In conclusion, may your Fireside Girl experience be a treasured one with memories for a lifetime. The end.
Irving: Umm... I'd like you to do one more take on that last chapter.
Candace: I'd like to hurt you.
Irving: That's a wrap! 
(At the top of the rock climbing wall)
Buford: Hey guys! I can see my thoughts! They're all sparkly and spread out around us.
Baljeet: It is the lack of oxygen; it makes you light-headed.
Phineas: I think it's time to climb down.
Baljeet: Ha-ha, coming down!
Buford: Oh I get it, we're in space. AAAAAGHAAGH! I heard that. 
(Song: "Platypus Walk" (instrumental))
Doofenshmirtz: Can you do this, Perry the Platypus? Can you jump really fast, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down? Yeah, that's it, Perry the Platypus! Doesn't it feel good? Let's be jumping buddies. Let's just eat dessert and jump up and down and up and down and up and down all day. It'll be our thing. Just remember: I-I invented this. Because I am the inventor. 
Candace: (In the backyard) Yes! it's still here!
Phineas: Hey Candace! How'd it go?
Candace: I finished recording, Irving's uploading it to the Fireside Girl mainframe as we speak
Isabella: Thanks so much Candace!
Candace: Yeah, yeah. Now the important thing to get Mom out here. (Hoarsely and quietly she yells) Mom! Mom!
Phineas: Do you want me to get Mom?
Candace: No! No. You stay here. Nobody move. If we leave, this thing'll disappear. She'll be out here in two minutes, with her bird watching group. I'll wait. 
Doofenshmirtz: Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. (Doofenshmirtz collapses) Aww. Oh, sugar crash. (The -inator starts beeping) Oh! The Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator it must be almost time for Roger's dinner party to begin. (Doofenshmirtz sees Perry on the floor) Haha! Sugar crash! (The -inator launches) There she goes! And you can't do anything about it, because you're on a sugar crash. (Perry takes a plate of food out from under his hat.) Wait! Wait, what is that? Protein, and carbohydrates? No, well don't eat that! (Perry does so anyway) No! (Perry chases after the -inator on his jetpack) Okay, but, but let's do that jumping thing again sometime.
(The -inator fires) 
Linda: (To her bird watching group) Okay gang, everyone follow me outside. The bird should be right-- (Linda gets hit with the -inator) Hey, who's ready for dessert? Doesn't that sound good?
Lawrence: Oh, see now? Brits like dessert.
Bird Watcher Male: Does this mean she wants us to leave?
Bird Watcher Female: Well according to social convention, I guess. 
(Perry lands on the -inator)
Doofenshmirtz: Welcome Perry the Platypus. What took you so long? I'm speaking to you through this amplifier right next to the self-destruct button. The rocket will soon be in orbit around my brother's house, ready for the next dinner party. And you can ride that rocket until your tail falls off, I don't care. Or until you find the self-destruct button which is right next to (Perry presses the button) Aw, dang it! Curse you Perry the Plat-- (The -inator explodes) ...typus. 
Candace: Mom! (She takes out her cellphone and calls Linda)
Linda: Candace?
Candace: Mom! Mom! Come outside!
Linda: Hon, I can't here you. Let's talk in a minute. (She hangs up) Who wants this a la mode?
Candace: Mom! (She runs inside)
Isabella: Look! Ooh! It the rare bent-bill knot-hatch! Isn't she beautiful? (The bird begins to pick at the rock climbing wall) She's finding material for her nest.
(A huge swam of the bird demolishes the rock climbing wall for nest building materials)
Phineas: Well, I guess they've got a lot of nests to make. We did build the thing out of pressed twigs and lawn clippings.
Ferb: Nature's little recyclers at work.
(Candace drags Linda outside)
Candace: (Seeing the rock climbing wall has gone) What? What? No! But, but but...
Linda: Oh, honey, I see it! (The rare bent-bill knot-hatch is shown to be on top of Candace's head) Don't move. Hold still. (Linda takes a picture) Got it! Oh, Candace, I wouldn't have seen it, if you hadn't grabbed my forcibly, and pulled me out here. Thank you! So, you kids want some dessert?
Phineas: Yeah!
Ferb: Some tea with honey would help that throat. And, there's crumpets in the conservatory as well. (He walks off)
Candace: He's so British. 
(Open on the Flynn-Fletcher house. We hear the standard opening guitar riff. Pan left to reveal it is being played by Danny Jacob.)
Danny Jacob: Dude, somebody's gotta play it, right? 
(Cut to Candace's alarm clock waking her up. She turns it off and gets out of bed.)
Candace: You know, universe? If you're gonna give me practically unbustable brothers, you could have at least made them not morning people. Yeah, I see ya down there. Hey, where's Perry? 
(Cut to Agent P's lair. Perry enters clearly very tired and chattering wearily.)
Major Monogram: Sorry you had to pull that all-nighter, but we really appreciate you filling in for Agent Q. With most everyone at Agent-Con this week, we're, uh, a little shorthanded.
(Cutaway to Agent-Con with every agent, including Peter the Panda, Pinky the Chihuahua and Lyla Lolliberry waiting in line for registration.)
Lyla: Yet again, I am the only girl.
(Cut back to the lair.)
Major Monogram: Anyway, Agent P, Doofenshmirtz has been experimenting with energy fields and it's starting to get dangerous. It knocked out our microwave oven. Get out there, Agent P, and right that ridiculous wrong. (Perry gets up and tiredly walks to his spy car. Monogram holds up a breakfast burrito on a plate.) This breakfast burrito is like a bean and cheese icicle except that it's larger and wrapped in a tortilla.
(Perry gets in his car and turns autopilot on.) 
(Cut to the backyard.)
Isabella: Hey, Phineas! Whatcha doin'?
Phineas: Hey, Isabella! You're just in time to help us build a zip-line tennis game across town for the ultimate game of sky tennis!
Ferb: Or skennis for short.
Phineas: Now that you're here, we can play doubles for twice the fun!
Buford: I'll be the judge of that.
Phineas: Perfect! 'Cause we need you to be the line judge.
Buford: Judge? Cool! Do I get one of those powdered wigs?
Baljeet: No.
Buford: Ah, I'll do it anyway.

♪ Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! ♪
(The spy car makes its landing in the building.)
Norm: Woof! Woof! Intruder approaching! Woof! Woof, woof!
Doofenshmirtz: Good boy! I love this new guard dog software. It's about time, Perry the Platypus. I was beginning to think you found another evil scientist to fight. Oop!
Perry: Zzzzzzzzzz...
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, what a little angel. I'll just have to tell you my evil plan subliminally, like, like when people listen to foreign language CDs in their sleep. I did that once and now I can totally speak Portuguese to sleeping people. Anyway, recently, I was musing to myself about how lucky my brother, Roger, is.
(Flashback to Doof playing darts with his brother's face as the bullseye.)
Doofenshmirtz: (voiceover) Luck is called "stinkelkrampen" in Drusselstein and it turns out I never have any of the good kind. Turns out that every object has a positive or negative energy field. I harness that positive and negative energy and created...
(End flashback)
Doofenshmirtz: ...the Stinkelkrampen-inator!
Perry: (yawns) Zzzzzzzzz...
Doofenshmirtz: Shh shh shh shh shh. You see, what I'll do is I'll zap myself with good luck and then I'll go zap Roger with bad luck, then I will ascend to become the Mayor of Danville and then I will rule the ENTIRE TRI-STATE...
Perry: (yawns) Zzzzzzzzz...
Doofenshmirtz: I will rule the entire Tri-State Area. Aw, man, Norm, I told you, on the paper! On the paper! (Cut to reveal that Norm is drawing on the wall) Bad dog! 
(Cut back to the backyard.)
Phineas: Looking good, guys! All we need to do is hammer in this last nail and we'll be ready to go. (The gang gets zapped by the Stinkelkrampen-inator and the top of the hammer falls off.) Huh, that's odd. Glad I always carry a spare. (The hammer falls off and hits Ferb's shoe.) Whoa! Good thing you're wearing your steel-tip sneakers.
Ferb: Actually, today I'm not. (beat) Ouch. 
(Cut back to Doof and the still sleepy Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: And that is how the bad luck setting works. Except, of course, I won't be shooting random blasts off the balcony. Now, check out the good luck settings. And, again, I won't be just shooting it off the balcony like this. (He shoots it.)
(Cut to Candace at her vanity.)
Candace: Time to embark on my daily 500-brush-stroke marathon to manageable hair. (She gets zapped.) One...What the—? (Takes out a protractor to measure her hair.) A perfect 40º angle? (smiles) I can't believe it! A perfect hair day! I finally got my PHD!
Lawrence: (carrying pillows) Oh, that's wonderful, honey. Not a single day goes by when I don't appreciate my PHD.
Candace: That's great, Dad, but I'm not talking about a degree.
Lawrence: Oh, neither am I.
Candace: Time to take my perfect hair to a bust show. (Cut to downstairs. Her phone rings.) Hello? You're kidding! I won a random contest to sing backup for Love Händel at the Danville 24 Hour Music Awards?! Sweet! Perfect hair day? Backup singer for Love Händel? That could only mean... Wait. Lemme try one last thing. (Falls backwards. Wide shot to reveal she landed on two pillows. She gasps.) Pillows magically appear to break my fall! It's true! I'm finally having good luck!
Lawrence: I was using my PHD. My Pillow Hurling Dexterity.
(beat)
Candace: Meh. Still lucky. (gasp) I'll actually be able to bust Phineas and Ferb today! Oh, wait. Mom's at that weekend-long plant-potting retreat. (Her phone rings.) Hi, Mom! The seminar's over already?
(Cut to Linda.)
Linda: Yeah, apparently, you just put some dirt in a pot. I don't know why I cleared my whole schedule.
(Cut back to Candace.)
Candace: Great! See you at four! (off the phone) Yes! Today is the day that I bust Phineas and Ferb! Woohoo!
(Cut back to the backyard. The structure falls apart.)
Phineas: I just don't get it. Everything we try to do either falls apart, breaks, or somehow ends up backwards.
Baljeet: I know this goes completely against all logic and therefore makes it totally out of character for me to say, but I think you may have been cursed with bad luck.
Phineas: (gasp) Bad luck?!
(Dramatic organ music plays. Zoom in on Phineas' face. Whip pan right to reveal Danny Jacob now playing the keyboard.)
Danny Jacob: Dude, I call 'em like I see 'em.
(Whip back to the gang.)
Phineas: Hmm, bad luck. That's a new one!
Isabella: It happens. There's not much you can do about it.
Phineas: No! There is something we can do about it! If we can create algorithms to predict bad luck, we can make allowances for it and still have fun!
Baljeet: Just like the failsafe systems on space capsules or airplanes!
Phineas: Exactly! We'll make having bad luck fun!
Isabella: Cool! 
(Cut to somewhere downtown. Doof is standing by his van with a still sleeping Perry in a little red wagon holding his inator.)
Doofenshmirtz: Okay, it's time to go. Luck and cover. (He shoots himself with the inator and chuckles.) Good stinkelkrampen tickles! (gasp) Look, a penny! It's working! Aw, man, tails! Well, you know the rules, Heinz. Turn it over for the next person.
Man: I say, a lucky penny! Thanks for the flip, old bean. Here is a thousand dollars!
Doofenshmirtz: (squeals) It worked! Hee hee! Ooh, time to give Roger a dose of bad stinkelkrampen he'll never forget! 
(Cut back to the backyard, where the gang is on top of the structure.)
Phineas: Okay, team, all failsafe systems are in place. Go! Yeah!
(Cut to the roof of a building where identical twin sports announcers are placed.)
Sports Announcer #1: What a great day for sky tennis, huh, Markus?
Markus: Or "skennis" as the locals call it, Mark.
(Cut back to the action.)
Mark: (voiceover) Phineas and the gang have the ball in play so here we go!
Markus: (voiceover) Lob to Phineas and Ferb as Phineas sets up for a powerful return! Ooh, looks like Baljeet is set up perfectly for—
(Baljeet's zipline snaps and he falls.)
Baljeet: AAAAAAAAHHHH....
Markus: Oh no!
Mark: What rotten luck! Let's just hope Baljeet survives the fall. But Isabella is right there with the save!
Markus: (voiceover) And apparently, so is Baljeet. A beautiful airbag maneuver, Mark, which bounces him right back into the game. 
(Cut to Doof's van. He places the sleeping platypus in his seat.)

Doofenshmirtz: Down you go, Perry the Sleepapus. (He turns on the ignition.) And away we go! (All the traffic lights turn green.) Sweet!
Food Truck Lady: Free samples?
Doofenshmirtz: (takes some) Thank you! Mmm, mmm, I could get used to this good luck thing. It's better than having a genie. That was a mistake.
(Cutaway to a genie after he's transformed Doof into a giant wiener.)
Wienershmirtz: That wasn't a wish! It's just a song! It's not even a song! It's a jingle!!
(End cutaway.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ugh. Y'ever try to sue a genie? Oh, you're asleep. W-Well, let's try to see what kind of tunes are on the FM dial.

(Cut to City Hall. The van pulls up.)
Doofenshmirtz: I love it when the song ends right as you reach your destination! Not to mention the free cans of almond brittle that I got during the chorus. (Cut to inside City Hall.) Well, hello, Roger.
Roger: Hello, Heinz. What can I do for you?
Doofenshmirtz: Well, little brother, you have had nothing but good luck your whole life, and I'm here to even things up for once!
Roger: Oh, Heinz, the power of positive stinkelkrampen is the result of hard work, strong networking and thoughtful actions in matters both business and personal.
Doofenshmirtz: Pfft! I prefer to inator my way to success...just like I wrote in my book! Available in dollar bins everywhere! 
(Cut back to the game.)
Mark: Now let's see what Ferb can do with Isabella's blistering smash. Wow! I've never seen a racket spontaneously become unstrung!
Markus: Ferb's shot is headed straight for Isabella and she...
(One of the wires snaps.)
Mark: (voiceover) Oh, that is a tough break! She's flying right past the gap. This is absolutely amazing!
(Cut back to the roof.)
Janitor: Hey, do you guys have a permit to do sports commentary on this roof?
Markus: We...totally have one.
Mark: We do.
Markus: (getting out of his chair) It's in the production truck downstairs.
Mark: (also getting out of his chair) Which totally exists. Let's get outta here! 
(Cut to the living room where Candace is sitting in her chair reading a book.)
Linda: (offscreen) I'm home!
Candace: Hi, Mom!
(Cut to the front door where Linda is carrying a familiar looking potted plant and a bag of mulch.)
Linda: I know you wanna drag me to the backyard right now, Candace, but can it wait until I repot my new plant?
Candace: (offscreen, sarcastically) No prob, Mom, Take your time.
Linda: Oooookay....Uh, thanks, hon. I—Oof! (She bumps into a jacket and a fedora drops onto the potted plant revealing itself to be none other than Planty the Potted Plant himself!) Oh, how cute! My new plant looks like a little secret agent! Huh. How about you guard this alcove, Mr. Secret Agent Plant. (giggles)
(Planty goes down the alcove into Agent P's lair.)
Major Monogram: Sorry, Planty the Potted Plant, but apparently your cover's been blown. I'm afraid you'll have to be repotted with another family.
(Planty wilts sadly.) 
(Cut back to City Hall.)
Doofenshmirtz: Alright, Roger, prepare to suffer the bad luck of the dra— (Roger gets up from his desk) Hey, hey, hey! Hey, wait! Wait a minute! You're s'posed to stay still for a good inatoring!
Roger: Aw, but I just realized I haven't said hello to your little platypus friend.
Doofenshmirtz: Careful. He gets a little testy if you wake him up from his nap too soo— (The floor creaks and Perry suddenly wakes up.) Uh oh.
(Perry attacks Doof.)
Roger: Aw, yes. I'm not a morning person either. 
(Cut to the backyard.)
Phineas: Great game, guys!
Candace: (from below) Hello, brothers! (cut to her with a pie) I made you a pie...for your Bust Day!
Phineas: Well, that can't be right. (takes out a flyer) Bus Day isn't until next week. (Cut to the flyer which reads: "Celebrate Bus Day Next Week" with a yellow bus with a happy face on it) Guess she's getting a head start. 
(Cut back to City Hall where Perry is beating the youknowwhat out of Doof. Doof throws his inator away and Perry destroys the pack on his back.)
Doofenshmirtz: Oh no. Now my luck's gonna go back to normal...which is, of course, bad! 
(Cut back to the backyard, where Candace is inexplicably dancing with her pie, oblivious to the rays revolving around her and the kids.)
Candace: Just take your time, it's not like the earth is gonna open up and s-wallow it, (chuckles, tosses pie in the air) not today! (splat!) Oof. (gasps) Oh no! That means... (runs into the house) MOOOOM!!! MOM MOM MOM MOM!
(The earth opens up and swallows the structure.)
Phineas: And right after Candace said that couldn't happen.
Buford: Yeah. That's borderline creepy.
Linda: Candace, you still haven't explained why you're covered with pie.
Candace: Oh, just come on, this will explain everything! A-bu-bu-wuh?
Phineas: Hi, Mom!
Candace: A-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu...but... 
(Cut to Doof outside City Hall.)
Doofenshmirtz: Well, my luck may be back to normal but at least I still have an entire trunk full of delicious almond brittle. (Opens a can and fake snakes pop out.) Ugh. Mental note: Never accept canned confections from a guy in a clown suit. 
(Open up on the backyard. Isabella, Buford, Baljeet, Perry, Phineas, and Ferb are looking at what looks like a mountain of some sort.)
Phineas: Okay, gang. Today, we're gonna tie a legendary knot.
Buford: Woah woah woah! We're just startin'?! No—no intro, nothin'?! Just gettin' right into it?
Phineas: Yep, we're just doin' the knot.
Buford: Wait, how can we do something not?
Phineas: No, it's "knot" spelled with a "k".
Buford: I didn't think it was spelled with a "k".
Phineas: No. It's "knot".....spelled with a "k".
Buford: I don't understand your pauses.
Phineas: Well, lemme start over. Today, we're gonna reproduce the Gordian Knot.
Buford: Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
Isabella: I've heard of that, but I can't remember the story.
Buford: I got this. Back in the day where men wore miniskirts...wiggle wiggle wiggle...wiggle wiggle wiggle... 
(Flashback. In this flashback, the role of Alexander the Great will be played by Buford van Stomm.)
Buford: (voiceover) ...Alexander the Great was vacationing in Gordium, when he came upon a celebrated oxcart that was tied to a post using a knot that was so complicated, it was impossible to untie. So he just sliced it in half in one bold stroke.
(End flashback) 
Buford: A simple solution to a complicated problem, hence the phrase, "Cutting the Gordian Knot."
Isabella: I've never heard that phrase!
Baljeet: That is new to me.
Buford: Trust me, it's a thing.
Phineas: So, we'll tie these ropes around our waists, and follow this blueprint to recreate it, then it's up to us to figure out how to get loose. That'll make us the second people to tie the Gordian Knot, but the first people to untie it!
Baljeet: What if we cannot untie it?
Phineas: (tying his rope around his waist) No problem. Our mom was always really good with knots. There was this one time when Candace—
(record scratch)
Candace: (leaning against the door) Hey! I thought we weren't going to bring up the clothesline incident ever again!
Phineas: Oh, right. Anyway, would you mind getting Mom if we get stuck in the ginormous Gordian Knot we're making?
Candace: When it gets big and weird, I'll go get Mom.
Phineas: Excellent! Does everyone have their ropes tied? Alright, lessee, Isabella and Buford, make two loops where you're standing. Great! You're good to start climbing. Baljeet, turn twice counterclockwise and then dive in five loops from the bottom. Then Ferb and I will do this and this and this, and we'll join you inside.
Ferb: Shall we?
Phineas: Absolutely. Let's go, bro! Baljeet and Ferb, twist to the right and wiggle towards the top. Hey, where's Perry? 
(Cut to Perry somewhere around the house. He puts on his fedora and expects something to happen. Nothing happens. So he shrugs and gets a shovel labeled "Analog Lair Entrance". He begins digging down to his lair. Cut to the lair. Some dirt falls from above into Agent P's chair and Agent P follows.)
Major Monogram: Morning, Agent P! Seems that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been hitting every all-you-can-eat buffet in town, which can't be good! If anything were to happen to Doofenshmirtz, we would have to make some drastic cuts over here! (looking aside) Especially in the non-essential personnel department. (Perry starts to vacuum all the dirt off the chair.) Good luck, Agent P. Oh, don't worry about the mess, uh, Carl will take care of it.
Carl: (off screen) I guess that makes me essential, huh?!
Major Monogram: Don't get cocky, Carl. 
(Cut back to the Flynn-Fletcher house. The doorbell is heard ringing.)
Jeremy: Hey, Candace.
(Cut to the front door. Candace answered the door and Jeremy is in his Mr. Slushy Dawg uniform carrying a safe.)
Candace: Hi, Jeremy. What a nice surprise! (sees the safe) Ooh, what's that?
Jeremy: Oh, it's an old mini safe of mine that I found in the back of my closet. I've had it for ages, but I haven't used it in so long that I forgot the combination. I thought your brothers could open it. I figured that's a "safe" bet. Heh heh!
Candace: So what's in it?
Jeremy: That's the thing. I don't remember.
Candace: Maybe it's a rare baseball card.
Jeremy: No, I sold all those a long time ago.
Candace: Um, could it be your favorite toy car from when you were a kid?
Jeremy: No, I traded that for this safe.
Candace: Well, maybe it's something cute, like your baby teeth.
Jeremy: Nope. Definitely not. I still got those. (He lifts his upper lip to reveal his baby teeth stuck in his gums.)
Candace: Ew. I mean, cute!
Jeremy: Yeah, the Tooth Fairy never visited me when I was a kid. (pause) Anyway...could you give this to your brothers? I gotta rush to work.
Candace: (takes the safe) Sure. I'll give it to them as soon as they finish their Ferbian Knot. Don't ask.
Jeremy: (leaves) See ya later, alligator!
Candace: In a while, crocodile!
(Stacy comes to the door.)
Stacy: You guys have got to work on your pet names for each other. So what's in the safe?
Candace: I dunno. But it's not baby teeth. 
(Cut to backyard where the mountain is now in the shape of a sphere.)
(Song: "Quirky Worky Song" (Jazz Waltz Version))
Phineas: (off screen) Okay, everybody. Two twists to the left and we should all see daylight.
Isabella: (coming out of the knot) Well, I just earned my Overcoming Claustrophobia Patch!
Buford: Ugh! Daylight! Ha ha!
Baljeet: Now what?
Phineas: Now we burrow back in and untie ourselves.
Buford: You gotta be kiddin' me! Who looked at this idea and said, "Yeah, that'd be fun"?! Y'see?! This is what happens when we have no intro!
Baljeet: I have been making mental notes of the paths and probabilities as I have gone along. It will be a piece of cake.
(Ferb gives a thumbs up.)
Isabella: If I just walk backwards, it should work.
Buford: To heck with this game! I'm just gonna chill here for a while. (gets pulled into the knot) Hey!!! Who's pullin' on my rope?! 
(Cut to Perry walking into a restaurant called Jerry's All You Can Eat. He kicks open the door.)
Doofenshmirtz: Over here, Perry the Platypus. (Cut to Doofenshmirtz at a table with a Dagwood sandwich on it and a high chair sitting next to him.) I'm just having a little lunch. Why don't you pull up a chair and join me? (He sits in the chair and, of course, gets trapped.) Whadaya think? Pretty clever, right? It's my new high chair trap! I thought of a high chair cuz you're just a little guy. Arencha? Yes you are you're just a lil' guy. (Perry chatters angrily.) Hey, you're not getting outta this so why don't you enjoy the food. (Doofenshmritz force feeds Perry part of the sandwich.) It's All-You-Can-Eat, you know. (stops) Uh, ih, you're good? (Perry nods.) You're already full, right? Me, too. I barely touched my plate. That's how these all-you-can-eat places make their money. They charge you like you're gonna eat a week's worth, but then, when you fill up after, like, two plates, they-they've really made a profit. That's why I'm opening up my own All-You-Can-Eat Drusselsteinian buffet! (Shows him a video on a smartphone) Look. I've already made a commercial for it. 
(Song: "Kronk for Hire" (instrumental))
(Cut to the ad)
Doofenshmirtz: All You Can Eat Drusselsteinian Buffet! It's food the way your mother never made! We've got Hassenfloffer Entrail Waterzooi, with Gopher Gut Au Gratin! Fuzzy Fungus Flugelbrotchen! And an assortment of tripe-based desserts! And those brave enough can try our new Mystery Lump! Remember, "Doof" spelled backwards is "fooD"! 
(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz at the buffet.)
Doofenshmirtz: Y'know, come to think of it, it really should be called "the All You Can Stand", because Drusselsteinian food is terrible! That's the beauty of it. Nobody will be able to finish even one plate's worth! My profit margin will be HUGE! But, first, I've got to eliminate the competition, with this, (Takes out an inator) the Eat-It-All-Inator! You see, it gives people a huge appetite and everyone will eat so much that all of these All You Can Eat places will go out of business! Then my restaurant will be packed! (Maniacal laughter) Maniacal laughter! 
(Cut to Candace's bedroom where she and Stacy are pondering over the safe)
Candace: Whadaya suppose it is?
Stacy: It's probably some dumb boy stuff like firecrackers or turtle shells.
Candace: Or maybe it's his secret inner thoughts written as a sonnet. No, no, no, no, that's not it! I gotta think more like my brothers. Y'know, use my imagination.
Stacy: This could be dangerous.
Candace: Maybe it's a secret spy plan. Or a glass eye! Or Abraham Lincoln's beard! 
(Cut back to Doofenshmirtz and Perry.)
Doofenshmirtz: Now, just watch what happens when I zap those people over there. (Perry jumps in his high chair causing Doofenshmirtz to fire off his inator. The ray bounces off a sneeze guard, off a lamp and hits Doofenshmirtz.) Huh? What happened? How could I miss? Oh, I'm so hungry all of a sudden! (He munches his way through the Dagwood sandwich on his plate finishing it whole.) Oh, that was great! I...I can cut out the middleman and do all the eating myself! (gets up) I'm going down for seconds. (He digs into the entire buffet. The man who was about to get his helping opens up a bag of chips. Cut to Doofenshmirtz eating other people's plates.)
Man: How can you eat like that and stay so thin?
Doofenshmirtz: Oh, I built an All-You-Can-Eat-inator that speeds up your metabolism so you don't gain any weight no matter how much you eat ever.
Man: You should mass-produce that machine! Everyone would buy one! Well, you'd be a millionaire!
Doofenshmirtz: Pfft, don't worry about me making money, mister! I've-I've got a complicated plan. I—Like I'm gonna take advice from some guy in a diner.
(Perry bounces in his high chair out of the diner.) 
(Cut back to the backyard.)

(Cut back to the backyard. The gang is outside of the knot.)
Phineas: Looks like we all just got a few more moves to get untied. Except for Buford, who's managed to tie himself into a knot.
Buford: I'm a victim o' circumstance.
Candace: PHINEAS AND FERB, YOU GOTTA OPEN THIS SAFE AND TELL ME WHAT'S INSIDE!!! IT'S DRIVIN' ME CRAZY!!!!!!!
Phineas: Sure. We'd love to. As soon as we finish untying the Gordian Knot.
Candace: Alright, it's big and weird. MA!!!
(Cut to Linda in the kitchen getting a pie out of the oven.)
Linda: In a minute, Candace! 
(Cut to outside Moe's All You Can Eat. Perry bounces his way in.)
♪ Doo bee doo bee doo bah doo ♪
(Cut to inside. Doofenshmirtz is stuffing his face.)
Doofenshmirtz: Ha! You're too late, Perry the Platypus! Buffet number two is history! I am starting to feel a little full though. Hmm, I thought it would last more than a few minutes. Better give myself a little boost. (Zaps himself) That's more like it! Wow, I am so hungry, I could eat everything at Buffet Number Three, baby! Yeah! (Perry bounces) Oh, give up, Perry the Platypus, those chairs are— (Perry throws himself and the chair at Doofenshmirtz. He falls over backwards as the chair smashes into pieces. The inator falls down and disappears.) Huh? Oh, man, I swallowed my inator. Oh, well, at least you can't destroy it now, because it's inside my stomach. So, today, I win! (Perry punches Doofenshmirtz's stomach and the inator zaps from inside his mouth. Doofenshmirtz feels his stomach.) Okay, you broke it. I can feel all the little pieces just rumbling around in there. 
(Cut back to the backyard. The inator zaps Candace.)
Candace: I'm starving! What's that sweet smell?
Phineas: Probably licorice. We used it to make the ropes as a failsafe in case Mom wasn't around.
Candace: Perfect! (She drops the safe and runs into the knot.) 
(Song: "Let's Go Digital" (instrumental, sped up))
(Cut to inside the knot where Candace stuffs her face of all the licorice like there's no tomorrow.)
Phineas: Wow, I never knew Candace was such a licorice fan. (Candace still munches on the licorice. Ferb gets out an umbrella and opens it.) Hey, thanks.
Buford: I am so in love with her right now.
Baljeet: What?
Buford: Nothin'.
Ferb: That's a solution to the Gordian Knot even Alexander the Great couldn't come up with.
(Candace finishes swallowing all of the knot. Linda walks into the backyard.)
Linda: Alright, Candace, what am I looking at?
Candace: I ate it! It was the size of the house and I ate it!
Linda: You ate it?
Candace: I know, I don't believe it either!
Linda: (looking at the safe) Well, what is that?
Candace: It's a safe. I can't open it.
Buford: Gimme that thing! I got an opener that can open anything! (He hits himself on the head with the safe, which opens.) ¡Para usted, señorita!
Candace: (takes out what was in the safe) A pencil?! This is what I've been obsessed with all day, a pencil?!!
Jeremy: Oh, I remember that! In grade school, a pretty girl loaned me that pencil and I've kept it ever since.
Candace: A pretty girl? (angrily) Who was she?
Jeremy: Candace, that pretty girl was you. See, those are your teeth marks.
Linda: Okay, Candace. You can eat the rest of that pencil. Unless you'd like to join us all for some chocolate triple layer cake.
All but Candace: Yay!
Candace: Ugh! Ohhhhhhh...
Phineas: Oh, there you are, Perry!
Jeremy: Hey, my baby teeth just fell out!
Buford: (giving the safe) Why don't you put 'em in here?
Candace: Ew. I mean cute!
